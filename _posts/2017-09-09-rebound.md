Well, something ticked in me and things are much better. Something of awakening the will to move, and the will to go. Or maybe its the knowledge that I'll be out of my parent's house soon enough. It would be interesting to say though, whether it's my lifted mood that "draws" good things to me, or that they were going to happen anyways, and that it is what it is. It does make things easier to accept in the right mood though. 

In other rebounds, well, I do hope you will get it eventually. That you can learn to love yourself and leave those who are toxic in your own life. That change is hard, and love is much more than always being good together. There's that love in letting go as well, which might be one of the hardest.
