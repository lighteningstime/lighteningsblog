I guess I don't write about too much stuff because I will think about some topic and work through it in my head, and then never make note of it anywhere, so we are going to try to make a list of potential topics that I could write about that I might add to whenever I come up with something. But the point is to somehow set up more inspiration for the times when it is working, and make it easier to do later when I do not feel like it. 

- Growth 
- Self-compassion
- Goals
- Depression
- Friends
- Talk Therapy
- Write a list of Goals
