Are you happy and satisfied with him?
Do you like who you are better now?
Does he help make you feel more open, more powerful, more capable, more joyful, more alive, more present?

If yes, then I can fuck off and leave you to it. I will get in the way and you can excuse the things you did. And then you can take your friends' advice and we can take the time to really detach and become just friends.

If not, then I can help you with that, because I honestly wanted, at least the light side was hoping that you could find the same amount of depth and passion in somebody else, so that I become more of a choice, and not just the only one who can make you feel that way. I've gotten the same, and it's quite an amazing feeling. But in the end, love is not enough.

There has been something that bothers me about us. And it is just this feeling of imbalance. There are so many things that I have told you about myself, and so much that has taken the effort to open up and let it out. Always trying to lean into that trust and comfort. And I feel like it isn't reciprocated to the same degree. I would think in the long-term that kind of thing will be a large annoyance, where I feel like you won't connect with me on the same level. 
I'm not sure if that has been just a symptom of our relationship weirdness, or if it connects back to that repressed feeling you have talked about. I want to connect with you on that depth, and it might be something about emotional development and breaking down some of your walls?

So, that's why I think therapy would help. I feel that based on the few stories I have, and the general condition of your relationship with your parents, that there is enough trauma that it affects you and could use some work to break through. The little snippets of parental neglect  and childhood emotional trauma. Lack of emotional intelligence from the parents, and the overall cold relationship with your parents. It feels like my own, and I know my parents gave me a ton of baggage to sort through. Unluckily for you it seems like a sub-threshold sort of deal. Harmful, but not overly so. And definitely not enough that life is awful unless you confront it. It does sound like you have tried therapy before, and that is at least a good sign. Perhaps you just need to find one that actually works well with you, because I definitely have had shit therapists. 

For me, there's the situation that I've shown you just how amazingly passionate and close and deeply loving a relationship can be, and to me you said, "I don't deserve that" and went back to your baseline guy that you're comfortable with. 

At the emotional level, there is this growing chasm of emotional growth or self-actualization as I move forward with myself. It is especially apparent because I am sprinting forwards really hard, and you have definitely noticed one symptom of it, that I'm more talkative and louder. But, that's the superficial change and it has deeper roots in my heart where I feel more free and capable. The speed is really that you're seeing the surface development, but the roots have been growing in my heart for a couple years. But also that you helped me through it so much by being such a caring and comfortable person to be with, never really judging or attacking, even in the hardest of times. And I want to give you that same kind of space, to help you through the same journey. 

It does feel like you're regressing and taking care of yourself less. Letting yourself go because there's no motivation to put in that effort, and some part of me is afraid that I won't like who you're becoming. And it bugs me because I can't do that much to change it. 

I need to know that you see what I see, and that you're willing to put in that effort to grow, because it won't be easy. And that I can't love you more than you love yourself. And I have a lot of love to give.
