Hey Hannah,

So this you can read, because it's written for reading.
I was doing some thinking and feeling, and I think for me personally if I'm looking back more closely, there's plenty of emotional/relational experience that I've had in my life, even if most of those didn't actually turn into dating relationships. They were more like long-running mutual attraction, but that fizzles out in the end, usually by a year or so. And it is usually this feeling of "ick." possibly related to your "got bored" of a guy. Which is kind of like having an internal emotional sense about who they are, and what they're like, how they act and how they think, and then some part of me deeper inside says, nope, not happening. And the icky feeling starts. And it's inescapable. The body has already passed judgement and its vote is hell no, and there's no vetoing it. Even for the one ex, the sex was still pretty good after that point, but it felt like a band-aid patch over top, where the deeper emotional connection just doesn't work. So, in the simple case of being unaware of the feeling and its meaning, maybe you just skip forward once you can identify the parts consciously, before waiting for your gut to tell you what you already know. 

But me though, I am thinking I have enough "emotional experience" and not enough sexual experience, too low a body count, but enough time feeling out people to know that you're truly something special. 
I feel inadequate in many ways and I still need some time to grow into full maturity

Maybe it's more about the whole honeymoon phase. You know, or could know rationally what types of things you like and and what types of things turn you off, or are definitely not enjoyable. And, if we can bring that mostly emotional process into the rational side, we can quickly screen for early warning signs and skip out on most of the time. At the end of the day, this lovey-dovey honeymooning will go away, and the full reality of the person will hit you. Or, it'll creep in slowly as you go, building up steam until one day, you look, and you just can't get it up. Maybe that's the experience that I've really been having too. Seeing someone early on for who they are, while still being attracted, feeling some feelings of love, but also seeing those flaws behind the veil after getting to know them for a bit. Perhaps it is a perceptual thing. In the early stages, you'll notice everything and dismiss them, or cover them up with "love" and just ignore it. But those things can and do grate upon your soul, and I think is another way to look at why your heart detaches in the medium/long term.

I've been asking around for advice on the topic in general, and it has been super englightening. Mostly people that I trust and that model the life that I aspire to. So Greg, not Jon. 
My list of people that I've been involved with. However, it really is just that everything is through mutual friends or situational, that going and meeting people is a different skill altogether. 
In order, Sherilyn, a bunch of missed things in hs, Ling, Caroline, Michelle, Catherine. In HS I was too layed out by my inner demons and the porn that I used to cover it all up. Never quite figuring out what I felt or what I wanted, never doing much or going out. It was a sad time for sure. But after that, there were a few people that partially happened; Stephanie, Jocelyn. And then Maxine. 
Stephanie was a fling for me, I think I knew early on that yeah she was cute, but I couldn't be that kind of guardian angel for someone I felt had a lot of depression and other inner demons to fight. It was a really cute relationship, and was a lot of fun when it was fun. We slept together, but never had sex. It was a lot of like a half-relationship, having that physical comfort, but not truly anything very emotionally connected. At some point, I was just too afraid to have sex with her, and I knew in my heart that it wouldn't last, and my heart just shut down. Didn't want to see her at all after that point. Like I could have, but I didn't want to add that connection?
Jocelyn was a situationship where we both spent a bunch of time together due to the solar car summer. It was wonderful as emotional support during a pretty tough and grueling summer of hard work making things with the solar car work out. We got pretty comfortable with each other, and had our fun times, and close moments. I think my brain always said she was too cynical and negative, maybe not as smart as I'd like, and just a certain way. I didn't really get into it thinking about it being something, but it built up into something from all that contact and time spent, but I remember thinking that it wasn't relationship material, and after the summer, if it could last, we'd be okay friends. She definitely thought we were or could date, and things got a bit awkward after that. 
And then Maxine. It was a lot of fun, some of the push/pull anxieties of an early relationship. Maybe I really got into it because I was stuck at home that summer, and she was a good buffer against all the bad feelings I get staying at home. I got all caught up in that avoidance, and didn't get a clear idea of her as a person. The like, stay or leave thoughts crept up really quick and I was talking about it openly with her (also a red flag) and it really ruined the relationship, not that it could have worked either way. It's always that heart-wrenching feeling of insecurity. It makes me feel constrained in how I can express myself, and is a dealbreaker of a red flag. I think at the last that means my heart is well versed and sensitive enough to some of these feelings that I know in my heart if things are okay. And really it starts as discomfort, and then progresses to awful flashing alarms. But the sex was still pretty good, and it lasted longer than it really should have. Definitely though at the end, it was like, my dick wants to fuck, but my heart's not in it anymore, and it just lost a lot of the enjoyment. So, great sex can't band-aid over a bad relationship. And neediness was something very basic for me to watch out for. Especially since it is something you can feel deeply in your heart.
And then. A long break. I felt like part of the relationship was my fault. you know it takes two to tango. And really when I was getting into it, I said fuck it, let's try this to experience it, even if there were some early red flags. And... I got to learn, but it takes the time to digest and understand things. 
The intervening years has been... trying to solve my depressive tendency. Although during that relationship, I did feel pretty depressed because of all the emotional stress, and being really lost. That was my start in therapy, but it didn't go very well, and didn't last very long. The other piece I found was noFap, and trying to abstain from porn. That helps to make me feel more, and unstifle my emotions. That period gave me the impression that depressive feelings can be an internal signal that things are not as they should be or could be. Like a check engine light for your emotions. There were a couple of relations that happened but didn't go anywhere, I discovered that moving away wouldn't help cure my demons, because they were a part of me, but on the other hand, more distance from my parents helped me grow out of their influence, and find my own reality. More lessons solidifying my feelings about people with strong insecurity and neediness.

I am so very thankful that we were able to become such close "friends." And so thankful that you're willing to talk things through in a calm and gentle manner even for those painful topics. And because of that I've felt in a way like my heart was home. No judgement, no anger, just love and compassion. In a similar vein to something that I can be for you too except with more anxieties (sorry). You won't even take my playful flaming seriously. Kind of a relaxing into the cuddle with 100% trust.

Maybe it does work out for you... and then? Well, we will see how things are for me in two months. Life might be very very different, and filled to a degree and I'll be satisfied, and you'll be happy. I'll be the loser, but maybe that will be ok.
If it doesn't, and things went well for you. You'd give her one chance, because you did fall for her, and got attached. Her personality seems solid. She's not the prettiest, but maybe if you see her dressed up, it'll be ok. 
If it doesn't, and things didn't go that well. Then obviously you go straight for it.

Homework for you. I don't know who is waiting for who anymore. Most likely you waiting for me...

Spend some focused time on these questions ... it's important, focusing on future happiness over alleviating your current loneliness.

Spend some time reflecting on yourself. Repeating relationships that all keep ending the same way is a sign that there's something there we could work on.
But for starters, properly identify what qualities or personality traits keep turning you off, essentially looking for the common threads for that "got bored of him" feeling, and getting that into conscious awareness.
And obviously, do I have any of those red flags?
And then a really really hard look at my flaws. I know you've seen a lot of them, and with some distance between us, what do they feel like. Annoyances? Liabilities? Nuisances? or Forgivable? Fixable?

Then...
Basic logistics stuff:
	What does the future look like? what do you want to be doing, where do you want to be?
	Willing to move with me? Work might get pretty busy.
	kids? how many?
	pets? cat/dog? okay with either?
	city/burbs?

The big question is, what is it that drives you in not wanting to be single? What are you so afraid of?
That to me is the red flag. If you're just trying to fill in some void of loneliness, maybe you'll skimp on your values and fake some compatibility, or that I won't pass some bar later that your heart or mind has set.
