It's been another month living this life. Lots of little things have happened with not much documenting.

I have finally started my luckily gotten summer internship. The work has been relatively interesting with a pretty self-driven work, although there are two "mentors" who are also working on the project and trying to make it work. They are a little divided in their time, so this constitutes only a small amount of their work. And then when I get home these days, there is even more work trying to figure out how to work out my motor controller, and get a board to start moving hopefully within a month from now at least. I have also started the beginnings of reviving my senior project and continuing work on it. Something like porting to C++ and then trying to optimize and improve or add the rest of the features in so that it operates well, and then potentially trying it out on a real car, if only somehow we could control that with the computer too. 

Thus these past few weeks or months have been rather busy and filled with projects and work and problem solving, that I have been moving away from more thoughtful reflection on myself. I do not consider it a bad thing to be occupying my mind with projects that I want to do, mostly for the problem solving and fun, while less for the end results, those hopefully these will end up being pretty cool. 

I think as long as I have the right intention in learning, exploring, and growing in a mental/intellectual way, it will move me forwards, as another facet of my being. The issue is that more personal relationship things are going to suffer a little bit while this is going, although we have been trying to be more forwards, in talking to strangers and moving that fear aside. I think another good step from here is to try to open up and be more vulnerable to the friends that you do have around. 

Some things that are still exploring are the idea of true love, that does not consist solely of those overtly romantic gestures and the whole homey feeling, but rather of caring for someone in a deep manner, in such a way that the giver does not need to stand to gain anything from it. The giver must not require anything, or else there are strings attached and then that makes it a normal human relation. Something like quid-pro-quo, though these do not need to be physical or material gains. It could very well be to feel accomplished, to feel loved, to feel like a good person, a good mother, a good friend, or even just needed. These strings are always a mess to wade through, and it should be relatively easy to see them. If you just so happen to touch upon the condition and reject it, bad things happen. No doubt about it. 

If someone is your friend for your approval, and you stop giving it, storms will occur, and mud will be slung. In this way, it would likely be easy to diagnose such a state, but I wonder if there is another way to do so that would be less destructive?

Lots of these things to think about, but maybe try working into this with someone you care about, and feel confident to confide in. 

The one good part is that even if it is not a at the front of my attention, these thoughts collect data and slowly move towards understanding in the back, so long as they are on my mind somewhere.
