I need to decide if I want to adopt this doggo or not. Just spending that little bit of time with him felt good. And I definitely have all these worries about not being able to spend as much time as I would like with the dog. That I wouldn't be a great dog dad, but I think that is the base worry that will drive me to be a better one.
