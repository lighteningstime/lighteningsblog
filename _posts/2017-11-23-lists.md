So in terms of planning. 
You want to help make food
maybe stop driving my car for the time being. 
Do stuff? 
reconnect with who?
or just dig in a little bit more. 
Probably bug Amy on Monday 
and go all in? cuz what is there to lose.
You've enough examples of friends that don't keep up. But maybe 
It makes you feel alone that you have to go out and find your people. But isn't that how it always is or always will be? 
Chase the ones you want, and eventually you'll have something good. 
Or maybe it'll never feel that way because that shows a missing chunk in character. To be fine on your own and happy to be alone chasing your own goals. And living for personal excellence?
Sigh. 
I'm thankful for James at least and glad to be free from obligation for a week. 
so, try to get lots of sleep, spend some good amount of time (15-30 mins) each day to write and think. And maybe get through meditations by the end of the break. 

What do you have to lose.
in the end, nothing. nothing at all. You can't lose what was never yours to begin with. 

But is that the best frame to consider this from?
