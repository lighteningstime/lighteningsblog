Happy Birthday! You're now 28 years old, and maybe things are going to be looking up from here?

You sent your reconnection text to Hannah, and she hasn't responded yet. I guess you didn't expect it to go great, given the abandonment aspect of walking away. 
I really really hope she isn't going to ghost you, but what should you do, double text to explain yourself? Wait? 
"That getting rejected by you is like a dagger to the heart. And I have to back away to let it heal. And I think I'm finally okay enough to not feel broken all over again if I see you."

You did wait 24 hours to respond to her reach out, so we can wait for a bit.
