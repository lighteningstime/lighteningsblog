Ah.
Life is getting me down. In all of its monotony and boredom, there is nothing meaningful for me yet. 

And I keep failing at my challenges. 

It seems I have no will to stop myself when the chain reaction starts, and I give in completely, just so easily. Why is that so?

And so now to have more conviction in this change that I want in my life. We need to go all out in setting up the system that makes things ten times harder to fall into the traps. If my willpower cannot tide me through, then we should have real blocks in the way. Real things to tear through that might get my attention. To shut off all points of access, and to increase the difficulty of all methods of failure. 

And the other thing to do for fun is that I put $100 into the pot for each time, that I will have locked away until I complete 90 days. The amount of money that hurts to lose, but is only 4 hours of work. It is a reasonable amount of money that I am effectively throwing away in reduced mental stability and welfare. At least in near term earnings. For anything longer term... who knows. Just shifting my life trajectory down a tenth of a degree could be hundreds of thousands or more. 

If all of this together does not do it, then I wonder to what extremes I would have to go to make it happen. 

So here's to you. Let's do this. Let's beat it.
