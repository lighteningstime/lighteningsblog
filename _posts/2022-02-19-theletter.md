A letter to you

And, the spell is broken. Now that the fantasy has been shattered, I've come to realize that I was becoming more and more needing, clingy, cringey, all at the same time. Feeling that if only I had your love, all would be okay. It was getting very dysfunctional. 
At the end of the day, broken people are attracted to broken people. And for us, we were pretty compatible when we started. But because of the love and comfort you gave me, I was able to move forwards in learning how to love myself and take care of myself. Life was pretty good that summer once we sorted things out. And it sounds like it was good for you too. Except that your interpretation was about having an "identity crisis" whereas for me I think it's more about finally feeling loved by someone for real. You took care of yourself because you felt valued. And it feels so strange to me because it seems like you don't understand that at all. The emotional connection that we forged is something that nourishes your soul. And yeah, I fell in love with you at some point then. It wasn't ever said explicitly, or extremely clear in my head, but the thought was always. "This could be it, I could live like this forever" and then... "But I wanted to figure out how to date first! ughhhhhh. I'd wish we'd met later." 
And that feeling of love, I'm not sure it is something I can hold down forever. It will fade over time, but we never really wronged each other, so it's hard to justify killing it entirely. Especially for you, I don't think you can ever get over it until you find something like that again. That keeps peeking out and leaking through. The way you looked at me after rollerskating, was a great example of the "find someone who looks at you like" meme. I just feel it pouring off of you, and it is still strange to know that these feelings leak out of you and you aren't even aware of it sometimes. 

So, the crux of this whole situation is about emotional connection, emotional repression, and how humans really work and relate to each other. 

I was starting to feel near the end, that our relationship was becoming more and more one-sided. Partly because you had stopped asking me to hang out, but also just that you keep saying that you didn't really have much to talk about. The balance of emotional disclosure was getting more and more lopsided, and that was a weird squeeze upon my heart, that I am so comfortable talking to you about everything, and you aren't comfortable to let it out with me. And then, the more we got pushed forward into this shitty ending, the more clear it became to me. That you are emotionally repressed, and that without changing that, this was about as good as I could get from you. Granted, my open vulnerability teases out some of the same from you, and that made it feel less bad than maybe it really was. 
And you know there's something special about me, with your song choices, with your behavior. Those are being driven by your feelings, and that part understands that this is something unique in your life so far, and you want more.
So, even if we meet in the near future or far future, there is something very specific that you need to work on for us to actually work out well. And even if we don't end up together, I know you'll be better off for it, and I want you to be, because life will work out so much better for you if you get in touch with your feelings. 

And this part requires a full buy-in from you. I already know that I can't actually fix someone else. The most that is possible to is to show you the way, and talk you through it, and support you along your journey. And that is something that I would like to help with, but I need to watch my dysfunctional self and stop it from slipping into pushing you along. 

The term that I gravitate toward is called "childhood emotional neglect" and the stories they tell and the explanations behind it really resonates with me and my life. But, my life is so much more obvious to label. And, I have already known that my parents failed me in some huge manner. But that might also be some of my therapy talking. You know the basic brush strokes, a sick brother, and little me, taken care of physically, but abandoned emotionally, left to stay with family friends, left behind to continue on with school as though nothing were happening. And my parents never ever talked through any of my feelings, or how I was doing. My school counselor said I'd be fine. That my grades were still okay, so it wasn't affecting me that badly. And I lived with that weight on my heart for years and years, never knowing why I felt so much hatred towards myself or my parents. And the big gaping hole of numbness, and big void inside that I didn't understand. But, I still believe that even if none of that had happened, I would have ended up better, but still in a similar boat. My parents didn't fail me because they were too overwhelmed by the sickness of my brother, they would have failed me either way. Neglecting my emotional self beacuse their emotional selves were also neglected as children, so they knew nothing about any of it. I have to say I am thankful that I get such an obvious event to blame, that it was so much easier for me to point and say, "that definitely fucked me up." Rather than have a nasty low-grade chronic emotional neglect, such that I get to feel disconnected from the world, and somewhat aimless, and mildly sad all the time. Never causing enough of a problem to treat, but making life a miserable experience. 

And that is what we need to talk about with you. There are so many little bits of your life that I've seen, or you've talked about. But it paints a picture of you not really understanding your emotions. Not valuing yourself, not loving yourself, not caring for yourself. Stories like being left outside in the cold by forgetfulness. Or the way you talk to your mother as someone to "manage" rather than be real with. But, nobody else has ever said they are known to be "emotionally repressed." So maybe you have some of the first step in identifying this as a real thing, a real issue that needs looking into. 


On the sex side, I think I've come to the conclusion that for most women, orgasms are about connection and vulnerability. From all of my experiences, it is that, first and foremost, female orgasms are very vulnerable and emotional experiences. You've told me as much yourself, trying to hide your face after you've cum super hard. And then that the raw physical techniques that make it happen, aren't super important. Obviously I have to hit the right spots, but we already know that female orgasms can disappear as soon as something isn't right. Or that the stimulation can put you right up on the cliff, but if you aren't comfortable enough taking the leap, it just won't happen. So that the conclusions are. Emotional connection is strongly advised for good sex. And if you can't get off, with a guy, it might be missing. And that's a huge loss in my mind. 


notes:
the spell is broken
dysfunctional on both sides
Broken people are attracted to broken people
A very narrow path for us to work out
lots of personal growth and therapy required
integrity
people who stay in bad relationships and live with bad sex
My dysfunction is being a "fixer" and so, much of my focus ends up on how I might be able to help your troubles and your shortcomings... which is good and bad. 

presumptuousness: 
small stories about parental physical neglect
implies parental emotional neglect
spawns all these dysfunctional feelings about repressing the emotions.
repressing your own needs, and being afraid to ask for what you want (e.g. orgasms)
Also feeling unworthy of it.
moodiness/tsundere as indirect methods to get what you want.

I think I might throw this into a google note and give you a qr code or something. 

I respect your relationship as much as you do, I'm not respecting your words as the boundary you're setting is very weak.

I'm not worth any more than your doomed relationship? Ick.

You won't know what we'd be like for real until you try it, so stop assuming so much negative stuff about me. :(
