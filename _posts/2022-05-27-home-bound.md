I just feel super stuck right now. And I am super frustrated that I can't do anything with myself except stay home. And it really is messing with my sense of self. It makes me yearn for Hannah more desperately. And maybe that was one of the bad components. I need to be not so desperate. And the future talk is going to be. I'm want you to be in my life, but my life is actually fine without you. And I know your emotional repression makes it a hard pass. If we simulate forwards in time, I'm just gonna feel super lonely being with you, because I can't figure out how to connect with you emotionally. As long as that stands, it will always be a one-way thing.
