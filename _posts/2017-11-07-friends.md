To be less lonely, go out and meet more people. Don't be awkward, say hello, try to make some context instead of running away. 

Get more sleep, feel more alive. I could keep telling you things you need to do. 

It's important for a fulfilled life, and I want my life to feel full. 

Full of people, and full of accomplishments.
