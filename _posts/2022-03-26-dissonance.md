Hung out with Beatrix today, and it was nice to be able to connect with someone who is pretty chill and fun to be around. I guess I can be fun and entertaining. Not sure what I mean to her, but it is pretty clear that this is just a friendship, though I like to be a little flirty at times. Maybe that's just a me thing. I wonder what she sees in me, or just the fun or intense vibe that I can put out. It's weird to think in such terms since it is so against my rationality in that it is not easily measurable, but your emotional connection with yourself seems to be at least decently strong, and the ideas that these feelings create are usually reasonably correct. 
For me it is to feel the undercurrent of sadness flowing beneath, but that it is fading out enough that I can have it and also be happy and somewhat fun and joyful as well. But at the end, that sadness underneath still exists. I wonder how long it will take to leave me. I wonder if she feels the same way.
