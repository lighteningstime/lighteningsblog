I think I feel more at peace with myself than I have in a long long time. 
I got my number one on the checklist checked off. 
And thus begins the process of letting go for good this time. 
But in truth, the library of my life won't let these memories disappear. So it'll be something that goes with my life, but is something that I must put down. To lay this fire on the shelves. It was inevitable in all streams beyond fantasy. 

I get that I am a mess, that you have more important people to work on, but I hope you'll come back to it at some point. 

The most that is possible is that you like me just a little bit more than you act, but that's only a guess, and does not really make much difference. 
My hope then is that I find someone who makes me feel how I feel about you. It definitely wasn't Maxine, but you still see everything you almost fell in love with there. I think the deepest was more familial love, just not the fiery passion, which is to care deeply but with hesitancy.

It's between the gentleness of heart, and a so far missing passion and then be sexy as hell. I'm guessing that'll be hard to come by, or maybe it'll just take some time. 
just when you least expect it I hope?

I guess it's nothing that I should worry about then, which is a good relief. 

And then Iris. I think it's past repair, but that's okay. 

And parents I think they are my biggest fear. 
In all of my reading and ruminating, having a happy family life might just be the best thing and the most important, which is to say ending up like my parents might be the worst possible outcome. So I feel sorry for my dad, feel sorry for my mom, and hope to god that I won't do that to myself. Be someone who learns from it, and doesn't copy.
And having that solid foundation. A solid home, hopefully makes everything better

So the ending was that you found a lot of peace. and you learned a lot from listening to those podcasts on your drive. 
And then, moving through and facing fear. To target those points in your life that scare you the most. That is your path forward, and your way to the best life you could live.
