Had a weird dream about a like underground bunker of sorts, with nice clean concrete that we would parkour to go up and down the floors. metal slides, and fancy moves, almost drifting as people. Something about special gum with special effects, like a confidence booster or an aphordisiac or something. Hannah was in some scenes, but it's faded already. 

It is some interesting emotional processing going on, hopefully the feelings will start to dissipate more. And the urge to go check on her will too. There is plenty of emotional connection to be found elsewhere. Better quality connection too. In a very real way, you were the driver for your connection with Hannah, she followed along as someone who wasn't all that in touch with her feelings and ability to connect in that way, but was influenceable enough to fall into your world, and the emotional intimacy found therein. 
You aren't completely sure if her refusal to open was more on her pulling away for her boyfriend, or just her innate discomfort with your "intense" emotional side, but definitely both played a role, and you wouldn't expect her to be able to connect with you super deeply from the get-go. Which... sucks but is probably more accurate. 

You find that you can cry out a lot of this hopeless feeling, which is nice. It leaves your eyeballs pretty dry and red though, but as a temporary fix to figuring things out inside, and cleaning up the issue at the source. But, at least you don't have to suffer through so much hopeless empty feeling, it gets in the way of so much else. There is another source of it from your mother, but that relationship feels way too difficult to figure out. We need to start with the self, and then maybe talk to my dad about it?

Exercises:
you are lovable, worthy of love, intelligent, emotional, open, amazing, and awesome. 
The negativity stems from your life, but also some from long ago. 
Taking care of yourself, loving yourself because this body is your temple. It is you as much as you exist in the world.
You have that good positive energy and vibe, you can be so much fun. You are capable of loving so deeply. Intensely focused. Able to self-reflect and change your life, as painful and as slowly as that process is. You've actually come so far from where you were, it just takes a good look backward to see how much your life's paradigms have shifted below your feet. Even if things on the surface aren't perfect, you are better than you were, and other people have noticed. Make sure we're still focusing on ourself as the main priority

You're doing good, change happens slowly.
