Feels especially shitty today. Maybe it was her instagram posts from the weekend, and it seems like she's doing just fine without you, and you're here in complete misery. Jacking off way tooo much, and unable to control this sadness. But, you never know from just a picture. A single moment of happiness doesn't say anything about how she's doing. But you shouldn't care how she's doing either way. It might just be that dissonance, that she meant so much to you, but you're so easy to let go. So easy to move on from. And maybe there's an extra squeeze because as much as there is love with Grace, you feel like you might be left behind and alone in this space forever. No matter how untrue that might be. This is the pit of sadness.
As much stuff as you know, none of it is yet in your heart yet. And it sucks so much to be in this transition to know how awful you are, and not yet be able to change that. 
Maybe also that the initial burst of indignation and hurt which fueled the "Fuck you" feeling and propelled you forward is fading.
