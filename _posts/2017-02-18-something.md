And we forgot to do yesterday.
But no matter. I found a youtube video through a pocket article about success and one good trick to use is to shrink the failure loop. Which means that we want to be less obsessed with the failure itself and try more to relaunch into a habit or action that is deemed good and forward-looking. So many times I feel like my failure condemns me to failing all my life, and that by giving into that I no longer have to feel the pain of failure, but rather endure a perpetual unease. Like being afraid of the fall so much that staying in the mud is better. But to live in the fear of falling and hurting is to live a life of going nowhere, and being no one.
