Sick with COVID, finally caught it. And I don't feel that much shame, I've been going out and about, and the numbers are getting worse, and it feels like my body's been going down. I'm not sure if all that MO was helping or not, or if it would have been more asymptomatic if not. And I've got nothing to do, and it definitely feels like my motivation was slacking earlier, and this gives me a good reason for that drop in desire, along with all of the MO'ing. It feels pretty much similar to the vaccine fevers, except it's getting slightly worse, and it's not going to be all that quick to leave. I'll get through this for sure. It's just gonna suck for a few days. 

I dreamt of my therapist, and there was some dirt pile filled with ants and other insects. Creepy crawlers trying to dig up my subterranean thoughts and feelings. And some amount of anxiety about spreading this sickness to others. I should probably call the PT and let them know to skip this week, and perhaps sign up for something next week? And also to do a telehealth session just in case with therapy.

I think my mind is so bored now, I'm thinking of you too much. And the thoughts are pretty much the same. Will you or won't you come around? Will I have loved and let you go, never to see you again? Or will you come back after you told me never again. Especially since the feelings are still all there, the pain clouds your judgement. But it might never clear up. And we've got a lot of work to do to clean up this mess between us. As well as all of the therapy that you'll need to go through so we can be equals. I don't know, I just want this heart of mine to heal faster, to get better sooner, so that I can look forward to my own life, with or without you in it. 

Definitely running out of things to do, I've got this whole backlog of anime to work through, and I'll definitely be stuck at home for a good chunk of this week. There is work, but I doubt I'll be able to get a ton done.
