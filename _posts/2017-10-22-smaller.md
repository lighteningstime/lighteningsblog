So exercise more, and meet more friends. 
We could definitely try small steps with either of those goals, just like guitar, is to leave it in a conspicuous spot, and pick it up at least once a day and practice those chords. 

Otherwise, still a bit alone, but not super worried about it today. Amy is still on my mind, and another dinner with Ann didn't work out today. So just a bunch of busted plans. We did have a decently productive day, just one that started quite late. 

You can take some solace in the fact that it's fate, whatever happens happens, and we can only influence the outcome a bit. 

Which is not to say that things that should happen will be easy... I guess I never like that argument much at all. So put in the effort where you want to put in effort. 

gah amyamyamyamyamyamyamy.... sighhhh keep the mind calm and clear. 

Maybe you should go check out that saturday dog volunteering thing.
