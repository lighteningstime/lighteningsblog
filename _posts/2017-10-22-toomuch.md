Definitely played too much, and now I feel kind of shitty again. 

Also Amy is still "too busy" to deal with me. But hopefully by next week.

Things are kind of meh, but I did get kevin to teach me a bit of guitar, which makes everything better. 

There's really not much "to do" and I think I need to find some more goals or people to fill my time. 

One good thing is that I am decent with trying to fill my own spare time if I need to be, and not excessively reliant on others for that.
