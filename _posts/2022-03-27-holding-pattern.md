Still a little stuck in this cycle of self-hate and sadness and holding onto hope. The pain is fading, and some part of me wants to hold on to it because it means feeling closer to you. Whichever way our futures work out, the only current valid option is to let it all go. You have all of your thoughts straight and your contingency plans settled. In the event that you're leaving and she never contacts you. You have your postcards and that gives her the last thread. Or maybe even that isn't something you can do. That you shouldn't do. 

Looking forwards, Grace's words of wisdom from a therapist, that you couldn't imagine your life with her before her. And it turned out to be something quite wonderful. And it is the same thing looking forwards. You'll find something just as amazing, you just don't feel like it is possible until it happens. Like worrying about an inevitable death, except all twisted... In all of our things, the steps we can take consist of. Getting out more. Actually trying to do the pick-up thing seriously. Making more friends, and meeting people in non-bar settings. Climbing league/Yoga? Expand your life like you said you would months ago. That laser focus on her shrank everything down to a single point of misery. I think with our improving capacity to feel again, we need to focus more on the positives, not spending so much time thinking it over except... therapy? CEN? other options? Maybe that is something to hold off on because it's so fresh and connected to her. 

No clear answers, no guarantees, just certain directions to move in. Maybe create a sheet of my own emotional skills to evaluate where we are and how we can push things forwards. socializing, being comfortable, social anxieties. porn addiction, the need to distract the mind. 

I do think I need to let out some more sadness. Haven't cried in awhile, and it's been bothering me enough. 

Waiting and waiting for this to slowly fade away.
