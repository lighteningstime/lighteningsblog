People won't remember exactly what you did, but they'll always remember how you made them feel. 

I think that definitely makes a lot of sense, for me and for how to deal with other people. Which can be to say that there are lots of memories of feelings which influence your everyday decisions. Sometimes we have some control over how others perceive us, and how they react to the things we do. It means it's much more important to gauge how someone is feeling in reaction rather than picking at exactly what you do. That long view definitely makes things much easier to live with. Which is to say, unless it's something outrageous, nobody will remember what you did, unless it's in video. 

It also means that each person has this personal feelings library in memory about how someone made them feel at some time. That type of more unconscious library can be quite interesting or damaging depending on how it is employed. That's also to say. That between emotional intelligence in not having my feelings rule my action, and having this library of past feeling to both access or disregard. Well, then there's a lot of things to deal with. Which also means we could actively go back and wipe these biases. Or actually acknowledge them and try to limit their influence. 

Lots of weirdness to think about. Maybe I could take a psych class if I do a masters?
