mixed emotions.
I think that then pulls towards you missing hannah a bunch. It really has been only a week or so, but having that much closeness, and then not, and knowing that it won't happen that much any more.
It really gets me down, but it also frees my heart to go seek whatever it wants without holding me back with any guilt.
To experience the full set of frustration, and rejection and failure over and over, but also the highs of the chase, and the unknown. To go out and pick up chicks?
You've been texting her a lot more than usual, and I'm not sure if that's just because it feels more tenuous, or if you've just let that love bloom in your heart, and it's just more free and open now.
Or, the basic feeling of wanting what you can't have. Whatever it is, maybe this will be a good period of separation, as a test. To see how the relationship works when we are just friends, and not having sex.
On one hand, with the idea that you can't be best friends with a guy/girl pair, unless they're gay/incompatible, or sexually satisfied in their lives. Maybe she'll just feel it, not as attracted, and never quite satisfied.
what do you want? enough time til April? at least until March, but much longer than that, and it'll be too close to getting ready to leave, and I'm not sure how things will work after that point. Can she come with me to seattle?
like You'd want some more time here to just get to know each other as a serious couple, before shipping out to something totally unknown. or getting stuck halfway. She did say she could move to seattle and just relocate work locations, so maybe that is the option that will happen. and then living in the city? or living in the burbs, or just commuting because it isn't all that bad?
money shouldn't.... getting ahead of ourselves, and the whole. I wish you could go date, and have your fun and then we could move in somewhere together.

What is the rock for the relationship, what parts of it do you need to test out still?

Emotional security. fun to be with. funny and intelligent.
Really emotionally is that being able to be open, and not feel constrained, not having any reason to hold back knowing that she can handle anything from me, and is willing to work with it.
Decisive, and in many things, knows what she wants, and has the discipline to make it happen.
Feels like home, the whole safety and security.
Smart enough to talk to about technical things, but not socially awkward, and willing to listen to some of my talk.

Maybe that's a thing too. that certain people make me feel repressed. That I have to censor myself out of fear of emotional harm. And that some of those I do unconsciously, but that I can pick up on it and feel the full weight of those emotions. It's perhaps really about not having had a good stable emotional base to start from. And maybe that's also something that you had to develop yourself later in life. I think we'd be able to get it done for our kids with the learning that we've had to do. Using love to heal old emotional wounds, and soothing old hurts.

repression repression, it's a function of my emotional health and well-being, as well as the person that i'm talking to and relating with.

What is this... i feel lovesick???
but but things are ok, and she cares about you, and you care about her, and everything is fine, but not fine at the same time. maybe a cross between lovesick and heart broken

Maybe in some way, it's best to create the space for some of these feelings to dissipate, I don't know how easy it is to date people with that "happily married" feel. Or this stomach churning nausea. What even is that about?

I know you've said some things, but maybe that's the thing. I feel so outmatched and lost in this dating world. I want to get the basics down, and then there's no need to go enjoy it, because goal of it I already have, we're just goign about getting the pre-work fixed up and corrected.

RSD says there's two halves of attractiveness.
the initial "high value man" appearance, and then a secondary "great father" type of deal.
the first attributed to the sex, and the second with the marrying.
Yeah there's all that talk about relationships and such and how our modern concept is very weird and strange where the spouse needs to fit into everything, and it's just a couple. No longer any mistress for that half, breadwinner for that, or political motivation for marriage. All those other things.

activate that and see what they ask you to start doing?
go out to bars and make your life happen.

I think it is my subconscious understanding that she's spending more time with her new boyfriend and that's heartbreak. Maybe it's better not to see her, so you can let your heart go and let it rest.
otherwise that's kind of funny, when you said you'd never see me again, we met the next week.
When you said you'd definitely see me again, it never happened.
Is it better to not? to disentangle myself and my emotions from her.

Maybe ask her, if it's easier to keep meeting less frequently, or just not. To let it go for awhile, and set things aside, not that these feelings will ever die, but to make them less urgent. Make all of those things happen, but be careful not to let your heart get away from you again. it's the mr. brightside feeling, She's loving another man, sleeping with him and staying in his bed. It will naturally feel bad for me. Not even the whole noble goal of being happy for her will cure that innate human sense. You just are able to control it so as not to be destructive.

Whatever it is, this way you can more clearly see her flaws and act accordingly. But perhaps it will be as you felt, "never see you again" means hanging out a week later, "definitely will see you again" means never again.
