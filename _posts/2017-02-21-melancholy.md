Something that I need.

> What is one thing that you think is good about yourself?

From the article that I have recently been reading has gone over the history of depression. Or as it used to be known more as melancholy. We do see depression as mostly a "mental illness" these days as something that is both a disease that needs to be cured, but also contains a bunch of stigma that tells us that we should be able to snap out of it. That something is wrong with me in a way that begets fear and evasion, rather than sympathy or flowers. But depression makes a person thoughtful and intelligent or at least have a lot of time for rumination and self reflection. Which also means that since we don't spend that much time on thinking about things, but rather avoiding them for days on end. Something seems to need to change. I think it's time to get out of this slump slowly. and be more thoughtful about your journey and how we are going to move forwards from here.
