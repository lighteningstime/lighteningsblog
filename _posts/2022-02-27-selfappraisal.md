A big part of improving the self-talk is getting an accurate and undistorted sense of the self in both a mental frame and emotional frame. Forgiving the self for weaknesses and short-comings, but also being able to see both the good and the bad components of a certain quality, e.g. An innate desire to help other people with their problems, but sometimes using it to avoid looking at my own problems. You have so many good qualities about yourself, and it would be great for you to be able to self-appraisal them to more accuracy, and more compassion for their specific shortcomings. So maybe that's the exercise for today

What are some good qualities about yourself that you can think of?
Charming, outgoing, fun to be around, good vibes.   Might be too intense and happy for some people, but it is only a facet. 
Your need to learn more, to be curious about everything that you encounter that runs counter to your intuition or expectation. 
A caring nature, trying to make everyone's life better. But, when using others' problems to avoid your own, that can be a problem. Make sure you have a boundary there.
Super smart high IQ brain. Good for thinking through lots of things and typing fast. But also bad when ruminating and repeating topics and subjects over and over.
