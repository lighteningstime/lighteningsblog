Well, maybe you'll hate me for doing this, but if I never got these things off my chest, I'd regret it for the rest of my life. I don't want to hold back anymore.

Note:
I was really hoping to be able to talk this out in person, but this works. Thanks for reading through it all.

Dear Hannah,

I've had a big realization over all this time I've spent missing you and trying to move on with my life. I think being just friends with you will be really difficult, and that's because I love you too much. I love you Hannah, more than you know. And it's quite painful to hold onto that love and feel you pushing me away.

And you're probably thinking something like "why the heck are you only realizing this now?"

But, that's not the realization I had. 
I've known in my heart and my head that I loved you since the summer, so it's been something I've held in for a long time now. And holding myself back is something that I've done a lot of. When we met for the second-first time and really got to talk and get to know each other, I knew immediately that I liked you a lot, and wanted to get to know you better. So, I did, and we hung out more and got closer and closer. After things got intimate, I had to contend with my own self-doubt. I was still trying to figure things out with life, and I didn't feel ready for a serious relationship, but I wanted you to be a part of my life. So I put up walls. Walls to try and maintain a proper friends with benefits distance. Trying to keep us from getting too attached, from getting too close, and from spending too much time together. Trying to signal to you that I wasn't ready for anything serious. And I think that worked alright for a time. The first time you walked away, my heart only ached for two days, and then it was fine. But you came back. And it was that moment in April, when we had that talk. Or really, you said something like "I don't even know if you're interested in me." And I said "but I am, but okay." And I had to reevaluate everything. As afraid as I was, I DID want to get to know you more, and I really liked you. I threw caution to the wind, and tore down some of my walls. I opened up to you, tried to bring you more into my life, allowed myself to be vulnerable with you, and show you how much I cared. But, I tried to stop myself from spending too much time with you still, with the idea that you'd need the free time to go date other guys. (I know I said that stopping porn was the reason. While not a lie, it was a secondary reason, I wasn't ready to tell you I had purposely put up walls to keep you out.) My love for you started growing in April, and it blossomed gradually from there, so there wasn't a specific moment, but I felt it in my heart every time I looked into your eyes. By June or July, I remember thinking it in my head. And that feeling came out in a weird way; a subconsciously filtering out of the word "love" from my speaking, as some stupid way to stop it from getting out. And also, the one thing I remember thinking, and maybe I told you too, that "I was afraid that if we dated, that would be it. I had all these plans to go learn pickup and dating, and I would never be single again if we happened." Which you might be able to see conceals: "I love you", and "I think I could end up with you". And I've held that in for all this time.

I didn't know how to get it out. I couldn't really say, "I love you, but I'm not ready for anything yet, so just hold on for a bit." So it stayed stuck there, and I got too comfortable thinking you wouldn't ever leave. (Totally unfair, I know, and I'm sorry about that.) And then October came, and my delusion came crashing down. I know I didn't react in the moment, but I cried as soon as I got home. It hurt like hell, but I'm almost glad it happened, because it kicked me into action. I wasn't ready to date seriously, but I loved you and I really wanted you, so I had to get myself ready as soon as possible. So that was what happened. It was a sprint towards my goals. You know about grace, the class, and the bootcamp. I learned a lot of things, got a lot of new experiences, grew in so many different ways, and became better than I was before. 

I was ready.

And then you didn't want me anymore.

And that confused me for a long time, because from what I saw, it doesn't make sense.
Even in my state now, having spent this much time tearing these feelings out of my heart, trying to move forward in my life, trying to forget you, the truth is I can practically guarantee you that I still love you at least 10 times as much as Kevin ever will. And I know that because you've characterized him as someone who isn't in touch with his emotions, and that his love doesn't appear to have made you grow. (Which is something that we would have to discuss and work through.) And while the words may sound the same, and it might look the same on the surface, if the depth isn't there, it feels completely different. And you don't have to take me at my word. Even if you don't feel the difference directly, you can see it in its side-effects. The most obvious stems from the fact that love and lust are two sides of the same coin. And they grow together, so you can use your horniness around me to gauge the depth of our love. (a little crude, but quick and simple!) Also with how easy it is for you to come for me, because this love is the connection we share, and it lets you open up to me so easily. Which might make it clear why it feels so easy to sleep with me still. On less explicit things, it drives the desire for physical touch. Especially obvious more recently because you weren't supposed to. The spontaneous hand-holding (after the roller rink), the irresisitible urge to snuggle up with me (also not allowed), and that really long goodbye hug in the train station (very sketchy). It also shows up in the regular times in all of the cuddling and snuggling that we did, the fun backpack/fanny pack/messenger bag stuff, tender forehead kisses, holding hands all the time, and being so comfortable while cuddling to fall asleep and drool all over the pillow. All of those actions are driven by the love that runs under the surface. It also shows up more subtly in that feeling of presence that you told me about. That you feel 100% present and awake and alive with me, all because I love you that much. Why would your mind want to wander anywhere else? I'm still curious about that, because you characterized yourself as a spacey person and a tsundere, but I've never seen those sides of you, because they never needed to come out with me.

I assumed that you could tell what we had was better because the difference in magnitude is enormous, it's almost like night and day. I was really hoping you could figure out that much.
Thus, the true realization I had was, if I never told you I loved you, that you might never come to understand that as the truth. 
Hannah, I love you, more than you can even imagine. I want to get to know all of you, for a long time, and to get to do all of the things with you. I really want it to work out between us. We don't have to end up like they did in La La Land. There's nothing inevitable about your path, because doing nothing and letting it continue is a choice you make. You just have to choose me instead.

And I'm still holding my bucket full of love for you, watching as you desperately cling to this little handful of love from Kevin. That little bit that was never yours to keep in the first place. I'm utterly confused why you've chosen what you've chosen, but I'm holding on, feeling way more hopeful than I should be. But know that I can't hold on to these feelings forever, because it hurts not to be able to express it, and to know that I'm not wanted.

Sincerely,
Denny

p.s.
This definitely brings up some things that we'll have to discuss and work through, but I want to make it work, I want to be able to get through it together. Maybe it's even better this way because things might be more clear.

And if you thought I walked away "because I couldn't get sex from you anymore," let the record show that you haven't gotten me off since October, so if I was after sex, I was doing a very poor job at getting it. 
It really was that getting rejected felt like getting stabbed in the heart. And that I had to walk away from the source of the pain to let it heal. And I knew that was going to hurt you, and I'm really sorry about it, but I had to take care of me first.
