Hey Hannah,
The thing that I held in… was that I loved you, and I still do, but it’s fading. I’m so grateful for all the time we spent together, all the cuddles and all the fun moments. And all the love and comfort and acceptance you gave me. You felt like a home for my heart. And I’m sorry for all the messiness and confusion and hurt I put you through, but I hope you were able to feel that I loved every part of you deeply. There’s so much of my “wise old man” stuff that I want to tell you about, but you probably aren’t ready or open to any of it yet, and that fills me with a deep sense of anguish. That I might never be able to help push you forward like you were able to help me. I’m moving away soon, trying to move onwards in my life. You should come visit me if you want, just let me know.
P.S. this is that plant trade, one among many things we never got around to.
