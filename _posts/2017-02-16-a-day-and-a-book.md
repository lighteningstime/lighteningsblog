Well, I think it will take some doing to be able to make this a regular habit. As can be seen, this was not done very well. 

We can try two things here.
I'm thankful for my skill and ability with learning things. Even if my debugging time today was rather slow, the speed of soldering made things progress much faster.
and with that I want to leave a question: "what is one thing you like about yourself?"

One thing today was watching a pair of people tag team returning a fallen glove. 

> Person A: "Did she just drop that?" ~goes to pick up the glove~ 
> 
> Person B: "I think so" ~tries to get her attention~

All in all one of those nice things to witness, except that I was just the dumb bystander who was only watching.

Small questions, small answers, small actions. 
I have been reading *One Small Step Can Change Your Life: The Kaizen Way* and the book's whole premise is to move in small increments to circumvent the natural human fear for change. For me trying to do lots of things due to my personal dissatisfaction with myself, I feel compelled to try and completely redo everything, and it really hasn't been working well. A lot of moves forward are met with consequent steps backwards when the motivation runs out. So let the plan is to move forwards slowly but with purpose.
Hopefully.
