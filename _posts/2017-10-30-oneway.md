I guess that's the thing, we have to decide on our own who is worth what, and make that decision. 

To choose what you're willing to suffer for, and who you want to fight for. 

Life was never about happiness of pleasure and easy living. 

Now is the requirement of someone who would be willing to do the same? 

Or maybe sometimes we can break that and live for someone who doesn't. Maybe that needs some reevaluation.
