Definitely need to work out more. If I don't, sleep comes very hard. I think the nausea right now is a combo of stuffed with food, sleep deprivation and that over-exertion. 

But enough on that.
I guess self-perception in its real form is something that needs some work. It is a lot of guessing and blind tries for now, just to try to feel out what other people are thinking, and recalibrating my own view of myself from the outside. There are normally too many thoughts that cast me in a negative light all the time, and that creates it's own type of fear. 
To constantly believe myself to be less than I am is limiting in many ways as well as being just bad for me in general. 
It's something with self-esteem and self-confidence, but also more about finding my worthiness in my life. 

All pieces of the puzzle that need to be put together.
