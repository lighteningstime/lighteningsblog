Passed you by on the street, and since she wasn't clued in at all, we stopped to chat for a minute. I wasn't ready to see you at all. The feelings are all still there, and now the pain that welled up wants to leave as tears. So, friendship right now is definitely not possible, but also who knows if you even feel the same? Did you feel... dulled? or is that just me pushing my expectations on you?

Otherwise, I think part of hanging out with her is to get a feel for just female friendships. And perhaps moving that one towards something more close. Emotional connection in a platonic manner. You have your female co-workers who you consider friends who are still just surface level stuff. And then maybe you could try to move things forward to something closer? It might be easier or better that they're both committed to someone else. 

Started off pretty bad, considering I PMO'd 4 times in the past 2 days, I had a remarkable amount of positivity or at least neutral-ness. That snark and fire that come with longer streaks is honestly more fun, but it comes with everything else, and that is pretty hard to hold. Maybe that's something to talk to the therapist about. Otherwise, arcade games, fun times, plushies and ducks, a weird ice cream sandwich, and a little more arcade stuff. 

And bumping into you. 

On my end, I think everything is mostly thought out. I think I have most of the skills and experiences that I really needed, and I feel ready to commit. Perhaps the last order or business is to actually pull a girl just to have done it. Then it's all about that ask of her, if she is willing to come along on this journey to find her self. 

But, we're still floating with no options except to move forward. I want all of you, not just some friendship, but perhaps more than you can provide right now. But you know, I'm worth that much. And it likely only lasts if we're both on the same page in emotional terms, in growth and the mentality to continue growing. Maybe you'll say something, maybe you won't. We still have this postcard ending if nothing else. But at that point, it starts getting very unlikely to happen. Sigh... and I still love you, and that still hurts. I don't think another week towards 2 full months is really going to change that quite yet. But, time is all we have for it. Anything else is distraction or cheating the process.
