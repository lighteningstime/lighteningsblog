I recently got to watch Don Jon, or at least the second half of it. Joseph Gordon Levitt did a pretty good job of elucidating the delusions in romance that we have as a society. He tackles both ends of the spectrum in their extremes and pits them against each other. One being the more often female view which is taken from RomComs which are so popular as to have their own little genre nickname. It brings with it the idea of the man being everything for a woman, and be willing to go to hell and back for her. And all of that is real love. For the guy to out as the knight in shining armor, dispelling all the demons and shadows.  On the other hand, is the more often male fantasy. In the world of hardcore porn. Where women are just objects of pleasure, and not much more than that. In this view, women do not extend beyond being anything other than for the carnal pleasures, 

Both are unhealthy and toxic for all. Though these relationships may work out to some degree. (even the Donald Trump has his own version). None of these will produce the true love and some kind of deep connection that humans are capable of.  And maybe sometimes both sides of the world will be true. Somehow, it would work out such that both ends of the toxic relationship can be both opposite and the same. 

The finale of the movie attempts to shine the light on both images to be the same no matter how disparate they may seem. Both grow out of a selfishness and cannot be held to true love.  The real amount of giving the self away in exchange for nothing could never happen, as the foundation is based on some material gain or desire, that is to be fulfilled.

And what is to be done? Is it enough to run away from these when they crop up? or is it possible to move beyond them, or walk past these types of lives., these potential futures which expand outwards. The hope of living a life worth living for me is the enticing result of understanding these questions and moving forwards in growing. 

I guess my current choice is to run away and push it away while I regroup and try to understand how I got myself to be this way. Try to diagnose what part of me is responsible for straying into this type of dangerous territory.  But what is it if I do not set aside the time to work through these? 

I do feel like having any kind of relationship could possibly improve my overall emotional wellbeing, like how marriage for men may be the single most healthy thing a man can do in our society, to learn from a woman about how to work through emotions and work towards emotional health. 

There is something so dangerous and liberating about real love. It would be so interesting to find it for real, though I doubt people just walk into it one day. To be so sure, and be so and not know for sure at the same time. 

How can I move towards peace with myself and understand how to be more vulnerable? I think she did help me try it out, but for me, it always felt a little bit wrong to be doing so. Like opening up would put her more in my thrall, and that it would be unhealthy for her to stay. There was a lot of aspects of need that did not sit well with me. 

Well there is not any paths except forwards. and all that can be done is to dissect and understand and then hopefully learn something to use later. 

Ah, why can I not just be in the 50% that do know how to do it right?
Well, here's to hoping you'll be alright someday.
