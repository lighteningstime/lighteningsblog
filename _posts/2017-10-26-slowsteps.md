Getting back to something like a routine for me is mostly trying to get to sleep on time, and waking up on time, to make it to work on time...

James didn't pick up at all, guess he's busy. 

And him, you're okay with being the force behind your time together and require little from his side. How does that differ from how you expect others to do things?

For it, you just need one of two, but both together is usually much more fun and much more balanced. Maybe you should be expecting more from it, or should you?
