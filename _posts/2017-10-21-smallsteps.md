Small Steps. 
I'm currently rereading this book to try and make the principles stick more firmly in my mind, and it might just be one of the few books that I bother reading more than once. The thing that struck me this time was the cigarette smoker story. It reminds me of my own shortcomings, where using some unhealthful avoidance techniques creates a bad habit that won't go away easily, despite it making me feel awful after the fact. I think it does stem from avoiding the discomfort of my own problems, and then having a badly "calibrated" sense for reaching out during hard times. But then, at this time, I think it would be too much to call james every single time i felt badly. I think our first step will be to lay out the journal as a symbol on the desk, and maybe type a few sentences in here whenever that comes up. And though even if it doesn't really change things, it will be one step that stands in the way. 

Also, we want to improve our self-concept to skew more positively, so what's one small thing that is good about you?
I think part of it is this will to improve, and the beginnings of rooting through the fear and pain and shit to understand. I think not a lot of people are willing or even make themselves do that type of work, or maybe just guys. Either way, maybe that makes you a little good.

And... still confused, but we're working on it maybe...
at this point, the thoughts are basicaly crystallized from thinking them over and over, and it's time to figure things out.
