Where does one start an introduction? 

Are any of the usual icebreakers really any good at helping us to get to know each other?

Perhaps we should break this down into a simpler question.

What is one thing tthat you should know about me?
Well, I find myself as a human being floating around the universe. Lost. But perhaps that is not as unique a condition as I might feel it to be. Where most people will look decently well adjusted, but still have similar thoughts and ideas. To feel as alone as this, is that normal? I really hope it is not. 

I am hoping to move forward with my life, and doing the same things over and over ad nauseum, and thinking the same thoughts over and over. None of these will break me free from my past, and let me live in my present, and live for my future self. 

So thus it is this that we hope to accomplish. To lighten my mind of its burdens. One question, one thought, one word at a time. 
Words are easier to unscramble and neater when organized.

My goal from here:
to write every day for 2 minutes at least, about a question, my day, or just a random thought.
and here goes.
