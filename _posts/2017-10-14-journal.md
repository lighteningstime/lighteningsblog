Well, today was pretty good for a saturday. I didn't get to go climbing with Frank, but did get lunch with Arif and was able to get myself to IKEA to grab the shower curtain and a few little tings. 
Still need some trash cans though. one bathroom, one kitchen, one everything else. 
I'm definitely spending too much time on work and not being super productive around it. Part of the idea should be that breaks are necessary and that I should not feel bad about taking the time in my hours to make breaks if they say 15 minutes every hour of work. that means 1/5 of my time will be spent relaxing at work...
And maybe try to do some reading at home and count those hours, so that I dont have to stay in the office for so long doign 9 hour days. I guess I feel more productive when I'm not at the office, and cramped by expectation to how I should be working. Now if only I had a good enough internet connection to do such a thing. Maybe I should spend some time downstairs in the cafe doing so. 

Oh Amy... what are you playing at...

Also, Arif is 32, holy shit.
