You're probably super dissociating. And I don't think I can do anything to help you. 
The most important thing between us was that feeling of presence, of feeling 100% there with me. I know you're probably still hurting, because I still am, and hearing from me probably isn't going to help. But, I understand that part pretty well, if you finally get curious enough about it. 

Hey, just a few things I tried to sneak into my note, but you probably deleted it. I wanted to say, that even more than forgiving me, I hope that you can come to forgive yourself. There are a bunch of lessons to learn from the whole situation, but none of them are that you're a bad or messed up or horrible awful person. As much as it might feel that way for you, I will never believe that to be the truth. We all have our flaws and our mistakes, and it doesn't make us any less worthy, and it certainly isn't something you need to carry with you forever. To me you are good, you are kind, patient, accepting, compassionate, caring, comforting, dependable, eminently lovable. You were worth it to me, even if it took me too long to see, but maybe those words don't mean anything coming from me. I will always remember our time together fondly, and the love we shared helped me grow a lot, even if it did hurt a ton at the end. Or perhaps that this mountain of grief reflects just how much was lost.
