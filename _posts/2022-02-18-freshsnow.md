I guess that's it.
I feel really stupid now that I've been snapped back into reality.
I've been super cringey and clingy and needy. Holy fuck. I think losing you the second time activated some really nasty bits of me that really wanted to get you back at any cost. 
I'm so very sorry for all of that. I know now that some of it was just you being nice and that you were becoming more and more uncomfortable seeing me while you were dating this other guy. And yeah, I did notice that you'd never ask me to hang out anymore. I was ready to confront you about it when you finally said you were exclusive.

The backstory was that my heart was all for it, but I still felt that I needed more work, and part of that work was to explore this pick-up stuff, which meant I couldn't have a girlfriend while doing so. So, I was definitely torn. I was already thinking that you could be it. It was a really good relationship, felt pretty healthym, and the most comfortable I'd ever felt. But perhaps on your side, it was awful, and although the love was deep, you didn't feel fully able to relax into it, because you didn't have my commitment.

And I still feel like I need some work, but maybe just another month or so of trying to do pick-up. And the rest wouldn't matter if it was girlfriend or not. Looking back, I feel disgusted with my own actions in their cringey-ness and how much I was pining for you. I threw myself head-first into the pick-up stuff, because I thought if I could just get it done, everything would work out okay. That you might wait just a little longer for me to be ready. Everything was focused on that. Trying to get you back. Trying to make myself feel ready for a relationship. 

And now my time had passed. I didn't make my move and my window closed. There always will be some hope that something changes, or that you'll change your mind and come back. That we'll meet again somewhere else and it'll work out. But those are all very painful hopes to hold onto and it would be like the "The man who can't be moved" level of cringe. So, I'll be here living my life, not waiting for you. I need to move on with my own life, which has felt so "paused" in the last few months, trying to sprint as fast as I can for the few things I needed to get done. But it was already too late. I've let go of my social life, and my sports, to "have enough energy" for my main focuses, and I think that has hurt me more. 

At the end of it all, my heart is broken for the third time, and this hurts even more than before. I didn't think it was possible. I had thought each successive time would hurt less, because we'd already been through it, but that's obviously not how it works. 

In some ways I'm grateful, that you've broken me out of this stupid loop. Made it very clear that things are over between us. And now I can be free. hurt and free, but free nonetheless. We could start on all of your imperfections, of which there are many, but that isn't worth going through. A nice slap in the face to help me start over. Reset myself, my heart, my goals, my dreams. To focus the depths of my love onto myself, because I haven't done that in awhile.

And my mantra has been "love and let go" and I've really failed at the letting go, and so this is finally it. If it doesn't come back, it was never meant to be.

I wish you well, wherever you go.

A blank slate
A fresh snowfall
To live and learn and try again
raindrops or hailstones
wash it all away 
wash it all away.
