What's on your mind?

I've recently been reading the naturally improving eyesight book and think I agree with it so far. It does have a little bit of mysticism, but nothing excess and most of the stuff seems experimentally backjed which may be a little better than "conventional" opthamology. The whole idea being that eyestrasin and eye tension is what causes myopia and so by slowly relaxing those muscles we can correct our vision to be correct again. 

It definitely makes sense to me as in giving friends back massages,. Where I can barely stand any pressure, Maxine really enjoys some really hard pressure, and she's only barely needing driving glasses. 

And then natural movement and flexibility. It all sounds like values that I need to train and improve in my own life, being flexible, and keeping in motion. To not fix my sights statically and go with the flow. 

To be human is to change, Consciousness seems to be change as all of our senses rely on change since they are mostly sensing temporal differences as in texture, touch, temperature, sight even. 

I'm still working on finding some self-confidence. Or maybe more properly is exploring that fact in my own life, my inner world. That lack of self-belief and confidence results in a bunch of secondary symptoms like this neverending crush. Where because I dislike myself, I am in need of other people who like me. And since that is not a guarantee, there will be pain, because it becomes a requirement. 

I think that earlier feeling of freedom to be alone, is now more dulled with the realization of how much more scary it is to be so alone. That it is an uncomfortable place to be relying solely on the self. 

Maybe a good question to ask myself: 
What is one good thing you like about yourself. 
One little positive attribute. 
Not that we want to fixate on tangibles that may be challenged or comparisons that might be made .
But to try to think of myself as a capable, intelligent, and worthy individual . 

Having lots of work to do is not a bad thing at all.
We are always changing anyways, and we only stop when we're dead. 
or dead inside ya know...
