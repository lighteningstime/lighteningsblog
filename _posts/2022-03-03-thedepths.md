Staring into my emptiness felt like looking at a deep pool of sludge. And crying it all out felt awful and wonderful at the same time, the flood of negativity bursting forth, and being seen through the conscious mind, just words of feelings "you're worthless," "you're stupid," "you're awful," and many more simple phrases, I guess it's all about being or feeling unlovable in some way. And instead of letting it make a home in my heart, we just push it all out, all the negative feelings, kind of evaporate leaving me exhausted, but less empty, ironically. Emptying out the empty feeling. 
There is a feeling of comfort around Grace for sure, the tears had been building up, and when in her presence, they fall so much easier. Without her it takes a little more effort to get to that point. 
The feeling of emptiness is kind of a lack of emotional home. The obvious idea that, if I was hard up on life, I could always go back home and stay with my parents, and feel all of that suction feeling of being emptied out. But, where can my heart rest? There really isn't any spot except for one that I have to build for myself. A kind of nest. But the bird metaphor fails here, or maybe it is instructive, since birds don't actually nest at night unless they have eggs or chicks, otherwise it's like setting up a tent anywhere suitable. Where, home is where I am. Maybe that's the real answer, that if I can be my own comfort, then it would be much better to try with someone else. 
So, exploring my own depths, it does feel like these skills about self-soothing, and self-compassion, self-care, self-loving, are all things to work on. And by practicing and performing the actions, the feeling may slowly grow in my own heart. We have so many examples and references of others loving you in small ways, and in big ways. We just have to integrate that into our own belief about ourself.
