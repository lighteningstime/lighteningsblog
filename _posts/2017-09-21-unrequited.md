I guess I need to calm down a lot. That... feelings felt in the past should not define who I am in the present, and the part of me that is still stuck needs to move on. 
Let's just say, I do really enjoy spending my time hanging out with you, and I still do want to get to know you. Part of me just feels so worried that there is no longer any time to do so. That any potential time is now lost, and all that's left is lots and lots of distance. It incites a bit of panic in my heart. 

The truth is that these feelings are like one of those ugly hairless cats, wen anything like real love, romantic or not, are like normal cats. So it's time to throw it out and let it go, or grow some hair and join more proper ranks. 

Well, the plan now is to keep some distance, physically is easy, but mentally is harder. And then come back to it in a few months, and reevaluate all these emotions, to live through them again, and understand deeply what happened, and how and why and what you still mean to me. Wheether it really is still worth trying. (me right now hopes so). And come to know it all very well. So maybe I'll do the same, wait until I don't feel so lonely, and see if I still want to know you. Maybe I'm jsut Matt. 

Thanks for the well wishes. 

And for the rest, well, this solution path feels the most likely. That hopefully you do care, that you do enjoy spending time with me. And that you know people who still are very much crushing are better off with some distance to work things through.
The thing is, I could still be wrong. Maybe it is the being too nice, or too polite, when you really just want me to go away. It is a fear of mine, that my empathy in reading people is way way off the mark. Or is it something with Christians and not having gender mixed close friends? I guess I don't know too well, but you don't seem to have many guy friends do you? though I'm sure you're popular with the guys :P. Basically if I wasn't so problematic, would you even let me get any closer?

My only problem with that is that guys are so much less open (generally). It is a pretty pervasive stereotype that "men don't cry" and maybe its just our society, but I find it much harder to be open around other guys. And like the whole james story... Maybe that's just something I need to figure out and work on.

The other problem that extends from this is Iris. This angle makes things somewhat more sensical, the cool demeanor, and the lack of depth. Sometimes you can feel how much someone likes you and it feels like bathing in happiness. But only in small flashes. It seems like she may have liked me for awhile, and I probably didn't know what to do with it, but does this mean it would be difficult to become any closer with her as well? And that unrequited love is going to ruin a lot of things in my life. That might explain why it feels like I'm kept at arm's length, but doesn't offer any solutions on my side. It feels like such a waste to be friends with no real connection. 

Bye for now.
