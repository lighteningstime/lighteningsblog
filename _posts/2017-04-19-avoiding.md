What are you avoiding?

And how do we work to move past it. I think one reminder will be that one bad day does not say that I have failed, just that I had a single bad day. It's about persistence not about perfection. You won't be able to get everything you want all the time, but maybe you could get pretty close by not letting up on those desires. Or don't let me stop me from my goals, but make life and its circumstances do that for me. I'm sure there will be plenty of things that will run that course.
