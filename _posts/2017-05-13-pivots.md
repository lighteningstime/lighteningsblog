I think all (or most) humans will view their parents as their first protectors in this vast and dangerous world and maybe that is why losing them can be so devastating to some people. To lose a place of rest and protection in itself must be quite an awful experience. And someohow one must pivot from relying on them as is necessary, to becoming that for others. So probably one of the reasons why some people never feel like they've actually grown up. That the somehow unresolved transition that may or may not happen. somehow I feel it must be more intentional or else one would just fall into the new kinds of responsibility without forming a truly stable base. Which still means more time is necessary for self-reflection and trying to parse through inner thoughts and feelings. And this work is hard stuff. It is usually much easier to give in to idle distraction to avoid it.
