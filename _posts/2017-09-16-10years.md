and a great big sigh......................

I guess in 10 years, we'll be friendly, but I will still only know you as well as I do now.
Just slightly deeper than skin deep.

So can I cry for a "what could have been"? 
or was it always something that was never bound to happen.
Maybe I'm a bit afraid of letting it go. 
That someone I really wanted to care about.
Well, if I didn't try at all, maybe we wouldn't ever speak. 
And maybe that's what it should be. 

But in the end, there's nothing I can do to change your mind. 
Whether it's just a rejection for me, or a belief thing. 
I think I've tried as much as I need to. 

So I'll shed my tears now, and do how you do. 
And it seems you wouldn't bother to think of me.

I think I could never grapple that line between an unyielding desire, and one that shifts to accomodate others. 
That if it doesn't stay despite the problems, then it was never real. 
That you could go around liking a bunch of people because you just wanted a girlfriend, to sticking with someone despite their rejection.

Maybe I'm wrong about it then. That the world is too big to stick around, and waste all this extra emotion. 

..........................................

So I'll lay these feelings down and give them a proper burial. To give up hope like you did so easily before. 
and vow never to excavate it by myself. 
goodbye to everything that never was



Why the hell do I care so much?
