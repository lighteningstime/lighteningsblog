I’m not exactly sorry, but I feel bad that things are this way. I miss you a ton, and I’d love to know what you’re up to and how you’re doing, but my heart is bleeding too much for that. What I heard is that you don’t want me enough, so I need the space to get over you and move onwards with my life. And you get all the space you want to do what you need to do, and figure things out without me in the way.

It tears me apart to receive your mixed messages. To feel you slowly pushing me away, but at the same time refusing to let me go. You tell me I should get over you, but you still look at me with those eyes. And even this time, you didn’t want a full break, like you didn’t want me to forget you. Do you want me or not?

I loved you, and I knew it a long time ago, and I still feel that way, but I’ll get over it eventually. It never felt appropriate to say it out loud with how our relationship was. But it came out in other words, like the fear that if we got together, that I’d never have a chance to learn how to date.

For me, loving you means that I want to get to know all of you. To explore every inch of your body. To listen to you talk about your work and your day. To explore the world with you. But there’s one glaring place that I come to a wall. To know your feelings and your emotions. To know your struggles and your fears, to share in your joys and comfort you in your sadness. And it feels to me like that part of you is completely closed off. And that’s something that isn’t going to work for me.

I need to be able to connect with you on that level. To be fully open with each other requires that as well. And our feeling of connection and closeness and comfort, the spontaneous snuggles, always wanting to be close, constantly feeling horny, that all stems from the my ability to open up to you, to be able to build emotional intimacy. But I can’t sustain that entirely by myself. You need to get in touch with your feelings and share them with me, too. It is an imbalance I started to feel near the end. It was a nagging pressure on my heart, that this connection we built only goes one way.

And maybe this is it, you might decide that Kevin is good enough, and I will never hear from you again. Or that you won’t see that this is a problem. And I’ll have to move on and find someone better.
