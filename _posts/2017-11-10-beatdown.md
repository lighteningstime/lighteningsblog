A feeling and a reality. I can only claim to be an intermediate at volleyball, and not that good. It just feels bad to get destroyed so hard as to not have any hope, but then that makes things easier in that just leaving is a very attractive option. 

My spirits have been flattened, so where to go from here? get some good sleep, know that failing means you're trying new things, moving forwards and trying to change for the better. Only the super simple stuff is what's already a part of your comfort zone. 

Try to take some solace in that.
