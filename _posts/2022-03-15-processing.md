I think we're getting through it. It still hurts pretty deeply, but when I haven't been trying to bury the feeling under porn, it has been able to process it all. Both letting the feeling flow through, and also thinking logically. It's a weird note that music feels enjoyable again, and I feel like I can dance. I think that might be both reduced porn suppression and getting through it. We're making it to the other side of this.

But also, being at home makes me use too much porn again. Part of me is sinking back into that addicted feeling where it is a kind of connection, but with nothing real. That feeling of being connected, I miss it a lot, but porn doesn't have that depth, it just distracts and numbs.

And, coming and going in waves.
And it's back now. I think this is the part where I really want to let go, no more hope, no more planning, just moving forward towards my own future without her in my life. I don't know if she will come back. I don't know if she'll be okay with self-growth. I don't know if she'll be worth it in the long run. And I sure as hell don't want to jump into anything less than serious with her. There's too much feeling for it to be clean. Too much potential for pain at the end. I definitely don't want to go through this kind of a break up all over again unless it was a serious shot at being together. Which in my model, with the lack of emotional maturity, and the lack of emotional skills, This feeling that I'm carrying all of the real intimacy is only going to grow. And the lack of skills in handling disagreements will mean that once I find things to bring up to her, she won't really approach them in a satisfactory way for me, and I will begin to shut down. She will hurt me eventually. I will hurt her, but I think I know how to treat it, how to quickly set aside my ego, how to listen and understand and empathize, and quickly apologize. She pulled a "not a big deal" sort of thing. And that... felt really bad. I was able to let it go by myself. With no help from her. I think that'll be the thing. 

It's starts like this. Are you questioning your baseline yet?
I want something completely different from you, and I think I can make it happen, but not with you as you are. I know you have your preconceived notion of what a marriage is like, and it's just like your parents, separate bed-sleeping type. I don't want that. I want that passion to last until we're old and wrinkly, because I know it's possible. If you're okay settling for less than that, then we're just not meant to be. And you've felt it with me, right? You know. If that's what you want, and you're willing to grow as a person so it's possible, then we have a chance, otherwise, it's never going to happen. And I don't want to get into anything with you if I know it's just going to end in failure and pain. It was so weird with me because I'm aiming for something different. I completely reject the relationship my parents had, and I'm willing to wait for the right person to come along if they can build something better with me. 
Simply, fully in tune with your emotions, as well as others' emotions.
The emotional skills to manage conflict in a clean and loving way. 
The presence of mind and body when together. 

And then the distance, I'm set on moving, so that'll have to be a thing. We have a few months. Maybe that's enough time to decide for you. 

What do I want out of a partner, and how do I get it?
Deeply passionate love. The kind that makes you feel horny all the time. The kind that feels like a home for my heart. The kind that pushes me to be better. The kind that accepts me fully for who I am. Sparks, touching, caresses, random hugs from behind, forehead kisses, random snuggles, and a desire to be close, never sleeping separately unless urgently needed. Someone to come home to, to spend my down-time with, who gets me, and who wants to be there with me, 100%.
Keeping that fire and comfort alive by being emotionally intimate, confiding like the bestest of friends. Seeking comfort primarily from her, but don't forget the rest of the support network. Fighting in a mature manner, never making jabs at the other, fully embracing the mistakes and mess-ups, and imperfections. Empathy. non-violent communication.
Building up my own life. Having fun. other things. 
It's really a simple process.
Being fully open and vulnerable. Emotionally intimate. Build the comfort, maintain that comfort, be someone who can hold that and perform the maintenance, to keep the fire alive. Own up to mistakes, show your weaknesses. 

It feels like that might be what you're looking for. If it is, I have some of the map figured out, and that is my end goal. Constantly working on myself. Rooting out the ugly, the nasty, trying to grow to be a better human, a better friend, a better partner. It's the only way for me. Either go all the way, or end up sad and depressed because it didn't happen. My life trajectory as maybe a more sensitive person, was to either figure out what is happening, or be depressed to suicidal. There is no in between. No dissatisfied with my life, but still living it because that's all I know. Those aren't options for me. 

But, all of that assumes there's a second chance somewhere.

Our current assumption is that she's never coming back, she's happy with what she's got. It's just me now, and some future girl that you'll find. She wasn't going to cut it anyways, and that sucked. You know not to fall for someone before you know for sure. Your criteria is much more hammered out. You'll make it to the like 2 week heartbreak rather than 2 months. Make a decision before then. You'll see enough by that point if you're pushing things.

Ugh, still feeling it, I think it really is fighting this last thread of let go or not let go. And it just puts my heart into convulsions. Back and forth. We want to hold on, but it's better to let go, you still love her very much, but it will fade with time. I think if we talked through it all and asked all the questions, and she said no, then it would be definitively over. If she wasn't willing to follow your path of growth, then there is no future. But, isn't that what the current situation is? It pretty much already is. Also, stop using porn, it not only numbs things only temporarily, but it definitely makes things worse. You feel more depressed and alone, you feel more isolated, you feel worse off as a person. We really need to stop.
