The point is really in trying to open up and pushing through the fear of shame and vulnerability.
Find the irrational points of fear and test the waters, or run right through them. 

Mission accomplished as far as what we had to do. 
To open up and talk about what's going on, and come to an understanding about what I want from her, and that makes things much more comfortable, and hopefully makes her more so too.
And then walking through my problems and worries, and the little quiet stories.

The ending was okay, but just that she seems too busy, and a bit reluctant to share with me too. Potentially as a guy-girl and feelings problem. So it definitely was not the answer I had really hoped for, but there is some good in it.

I think also I was not clear enough, but altogether, I don't intend to date you, though I do have a little smidgen of feelings left. But then those feelings didn't necessarily come from a great place, so even though I may feel, it doesn't mean that much. 

So then I hope it will work out alright, and if not, I wish you the best.
