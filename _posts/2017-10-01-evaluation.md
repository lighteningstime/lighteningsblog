So, how are we doing?

And also how do we treat our own self-evaluation?

You still have only a few friends, and not that much to do after work each day. 
There's volleyball, and then maybe tennis?
You've got the apartment figured out, but not the moving yet. And then there's car and renter's insurance to deal with.
Inside, you should probably call james again sometime just to feel a little better. 

Also should not write self-evaluations at night time, since I'll be more likely to be negative or at least feel it if it doesn't get down in writing.
