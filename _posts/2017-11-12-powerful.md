Maybe I'm manic depressive, or at least on a smaller scale it's such that the world affects me and my emotions too deeply. 
Like a leaf blowing in the breeze, at the whim of nature and the winds. Where can we find, the solid foundation within, or is it already there inside, and this is just how things feel if you let them. 

Volleyball today was awesome after I got started playing. I felt useful to some degree, though still definitely a deficient member of the team. But I could hold my own with serving and some of the hard hits. 
That makes me feel good. SO is it letting those through while still feeling the disappointment of losing a lot. 

I think the end is in how you reconcile your faults with yoursel. How much do I want to learn from my mistakes and losses, and use that to correct my personal outlook for my abilities versus both taking risks. So feeling bad is not a necessity, just understanding the specific loss and failure and then taking it all into account. There need be no narrative of personally sucking and that I should feel bad cuz bad. 

Hmph.
