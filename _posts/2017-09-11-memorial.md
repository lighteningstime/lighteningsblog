September 11, the day of awfulness in American history. While quantifiably awful, I don't have my ver yown "I remember that time I saw it on TV, and it scarred me for life" memory, which makes it hit much less hard. Coupled with the fact that nobody I knew was in NY at that point, and I didn't hear of much repurcussions in our circles makes it a bit event in history that did very little to rattle my own life. 

But maybe this day wlil be remembered for shaking my foundations in better ways. ven now it feels almost as though a whole new world of possibility is opening up for me, which is like an explosion of sorts. 

It was partly, figuring out how to broach the subject, and then steeping in the fear, and facing that head on, since there's no other way to do so. It happened. And though it's only a start, maybe this can go well, or maybe it will flop. Maybe distance will kill you in a lot of ways. 

But no matter, it's not the prize at the end, but the ability to pursue them that needs more practice. Staring down fear, and walking despite jelly legs, and telling the demons to shut up. 

Life is looking up, and we're tearing at the threads keeping us down, and holding us back. Progress. There is no guarantee for success, but such is life.
