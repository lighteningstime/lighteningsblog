Went and tried full on distraction. Playing video games, using lots of porn, and not getting any sleep. And it is a familiar feeling. Of vacancy. A comfortable emptiness. Where I'm too tired to really experience my pain, but also too tired to experience much of anything. And it makes me feel sick. I skipped work today, kind of a "mental health day" or something. But I've been crying pretty hard every single day the past week, to get this feeling out of my heart, so I can at least feel something. And I'm kind of tired of that, kind of tired of everything. My heart feels stretched to its limits. And this is the maximum distraction path. Video games until super late, PMO at least once, no sleep, no mind, no drive. That is what I was in a lot of ways. Always kind of empty feeling. Never knowing how to deal with it otherwise. It brings me back. And I hate it, I never really want to go back there again. It definitely is the feeling of regressing into my old ways, and now that I understand, I don't want to do that again. I was covering up my own pain, preventing myself from experiencing it.
