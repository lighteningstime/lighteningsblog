Went for it. I know I feel a little reservation about whether or not I can handle it, but he seems to be taking quite well to everything, and he definitely is warming up to me rather quickly, I think, especially for a shiba mix. He seems like a very smart dog, and those eyes of his run deep. They know what's going on, and that I think makes him quite sharp. He definitely barks a bit, and whines when I leave him alone, but hopefully he'll come to understand that I will always come back and make things okay. It's like the emotional class that I needed to take. To love someone, and have them reciprocate in a way that makes me feel more complete. God, losing him in a few years is definitely going to suck. Hopefully you'll have someone else by then, but it won't hurt less, you'll just have other comforts to turn to. 

Looking forward with this as a puzzle piece, it will be learning to love emotionally, and learning how it feels to be loved in a purely emotional way. To go through training and loving. Learning and understanding another deeply, almost like the pure emotional piece of raising a child the right way. Almost a trial run for how it will feel. 

He's so aged, but so spritely and young in spirit. Is that how all dogs are? They keep their youthful childlike qualities even while getting to advanced age. Or maybe that's how it should be for humans too, if life has been lived correctly. To keep those childlike qualities, to be playful and free, to move forwards quickly.

I hope to have him around for a good amount of time yet, but that pain lurks in the background, but maybe that is an important thing, like how you got comfortable with hannah thinking it would last for a long time as is. There was no deadline, and you just let things stagnate. With this ending clearly in sight, you'll have to make the most of your days together. To live it to its fullest and create as much love as you can for each other. 

Unconditional love. Which lasts forever, even if we don't.
