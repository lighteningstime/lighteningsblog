And the travel begins. approx $600 for airplane tickets to go from DTW to SFO to SEA and back + a car makes this trip worth at least $1000 just for getting there. Is it worth it? Yes it will be.

And as a quick aside before continuing down this thought. I think using these types of large perturbations to move myself from my comfort zone may not be the most effective. It makes me think that I could go on mini adventures by myself near home, by learning to do something new, or attending some events that are bound to be happening, or just taking some class for a few weeks? That kind of money I am sure is worth spending, as long as it moves me outside of where I am. And I could probably try to pursue some of those things that I aspire to do beyond just going to the gym, eating dinner, and messing around on my computer. THat kind of life just might not be truly worth living. or rather it is not a life that has been lived fully. And on another point, maybe try not to think of the lack of time as an impediment, just try to do as much as you can, and so maybe if we cannot fully invest the time, we can fully invest ourselves when the time is available, and that should be good enough. 

And back to it. Our goals are to spend some time with the cousins, and try to get to know them, try to get them to talk about themselves and their lives and their problems, and you can be a force for good in their lives. But as it should be do not hinge your ego, or your happiness on this being a success. only try your hardest to make it so. Imagine talking more deeply like the first time about what her troubles were, and firstly offer a kind listening ear, and then maybe offer some feedback and thoughts. And be honest and genuine, you really have nothing to hide from them. 
Hopefully someone that you would like to see is also around, and then you could maybe get dinner or something and just catch up a bit. 

And then, well who knows, you have tried to think a little about what to do, but nothing will really be clear until you actually see, and even then, I don't think the long-term prospects are very good despite what she had said.
