I think there is just a part of me that does not want me to be successful in life. That wnts to hold me back so that it can prove to me that I'm worthless. What a great friend to have living inside. I think we need to get the few things together to live our best life. Sleep well, and on time. Exercise 4-5 days a week at least. and eat and fast well. 

Take it slow.
