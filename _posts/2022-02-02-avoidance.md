I was definitely going to feel the hurt later, and I do now. There was so much more anticipation for the pain because we knew it would happen. But, we couldn't spend too much of our time together crying and being sad, although feeling that comfort is quite a nice feeling. I am currently feeling myself run through my autopilot response of sadness mitigation. Seeking sweets, sodas, and salty snacks, mindlessly playing video games, and it would have been porn, but that feels too fake now, which is good. 

I felt more at home, but also more pressure to perform and be a good host. To make sure things went smoothly. More dates, less errands. Showing you around a city you've not been a tourist in. With our initial objectives completed it was more about enjoying the time and experiencing as much happiness and connection as possible. To feel and flow within this loving space that we create with each other. Being fully present with one another, connecting and intertwining our depths, having fun and experimenting in everything.

Love/comfort
- To love and be loved to such a degree is something that will stay with me forever. Knowing how much depth and passion I am capable of, with the right person.
- The feeling of equality and balance. Being on the same page. Taking steps in the same direction. 
- All while independent and unique in perspective, in strengths, in approach.
- That I can talk openly about another with no jealousy.
- To see my world through your eyes is something marvelous.
- Being all kinds of gross with you.

Sex
- Glad that I could help you experience an inside orgasm
- Sad that it wasn't the best that I could do. I really wanted to be your best, but that would be pretty selfish
- I learned very clearly that the connection is really the most important part
- To feel the desire, pleasure, and burning passion is such a turn-on for me
- That persistent desire always floating in the background, should at least mellow out over time
- But also can be used as a superficial measure for relationship health.
- An emotional desire that goes beyond my actual physical feeling of need. Physically spent, but still craving that connection. So limp, ugh
- Tasting the unwashed grossness and testing my priorities

Fun shenanigans
- The pet name game. my yellow wordle box
- Crosswords and word games. Focused, together
- Not getting destroyed in Mario Kart
- Still need to work on the approach anxiety. Being with you is fun and comfortable, but then also no horniness and no drive to go seek others
- Pictures to remember us by
- Chapped lips
- Borrowed clothes
- Furniture building as a test for working together
- Borrowing each others' ideas

It really proves to me that to teach a guy how to be better in bed isn't easy. Because it was never really about the technique. That stuff is easy to teach. It really is about unlearning the distant visual arousal that porn is, and really connecting to the human being, the give and take of desire and pleasure. How do you teach someone to be there in the moment, and to really really love you and desire you?

I wonder if that's something you can help teach your friends about... or perhaps it's too disruptive.

Comforting a sad person is also an interesting thought. I remember really hating it when I was younger. The feeling of not knowing what to do, feeling ineffective, and then having that sadness infect my own emotional space. It was never a pleasant experience, and I always felt I was of minimal benefit to the other person. I think now that my own sense of self is much more solid, that the sadness is felt, because it must be, to understand the other person, but that it does not affect my own sense of peace because I know it is not mine. And from that space, I feel that I can provide a comfort that arises from within myself.  

It feels so final, the closing of this short chapter in our lives. To go from distant friends to deep passionate love to (less) distant friends all over again. Emotional whiplash. But no matter how short our time together was, we were able to go so far and find such depth together. I'd like to think that we got closer than most couples ever will in their entire lives. It's so funny to think that this started less than 2 months ago, so that you could lose your virginity, and it became so much more. A whirlwind romance sealed by a word and a kiss. I am quite impressed with how open and confident you've become, and how well you've done for yourself. In my mind you've always been doing pretty well, but it is impossible to know that much from so far away. I'm glad that my own open-ness could help bring out your own vulnerability.

And we were only able to bask in all the fun and happiness. Conflict and fighting takes a lot more time to get to, especially with this mountain of honeymoon feeling. But you have my whole spiel about the "back-half" of a relationship. I think the main book that I want to live by is "Nonviolent Communication". My main idea from it is to set aside standard defense mechanisms and letting your vulnerability show. And then using empathy to understand the other person's perspective. It is interesting for me to have learned all these things, to be able to have that menu of options when a situation comes up. A. To put in the extra effort to hold back my anger, pain, and blame, and be vulnerable, or B. fall back into simpler methods of judgement and finger-pointing (you hurt me!), or C. dismissal (why are you so sensitive? it's not a big deal), or D. backtracking on and apologizing for an initial emotional response, and trying again. But always, always keeping in mind basic values and priorities. Being connected and understanding overrules winning, overrules being right.
And on that note, I am sorry that I was pushing too deeply, and I'm sorry that I continued to do so even after you told me not to. I was feeling frustrated and tired and limp, and seeking some kind of reaction from you. Now that I understand more clearly my own turn-ons, it all makes more sense, and I'm glad we were able to find a better ending that was more satisfying for the both of us. (and sorry for falling asleep so quick on you too) 

Looking back, I had expected it to be more of a one-way street. That I could help you through your virginity issue, and show you my ideal relationship. But being that vulnerable invites influence to flow both ways. And I'm definitely far from perfect myself. I've experienced all sorts of things, and learned a lot about relationships and love with you. For all the love that you gave, I thank you. 
I'm glad that I ruined mediocre guys for you, glad that you picked up on this better way of being so easily, and I wish you luck on your journey forward. You have my map now, which has been my slow search for what I want over the past 5 years(?!). I believe you can find all that you're looking for, and I believe you're worth it all. It won't be the easiest thing in the world, but you'll find the happiness that you're looking for, and I'll be cheering you on from wherever I am. 

Timeline
Thursday night, I did too much foreplay, and it was too tense.
Friday was a workday, but climbing after and tapas for dinner. Friday night, you were too tired because I kept messing around the night before because of the horniness, it was hard to resist, but we slept well.
Saturday was the sex day, Once in the morning, once again at night. Breakfast, portillos for lunch, walking around IKEA and helping me assemble another bookshelf. Moretti's for dinner, and some time at the bar. 
We did soooo many things Sunday, a rushed breakfast, late to ice skating, bean counting, lakefront walks, pho, boba, hugo tea, signature lounge, sushi, and more sex
And Monday, very distracted work, with heartbreak beginning to seep in. Cuddles, snuggles, and a drop-off.
