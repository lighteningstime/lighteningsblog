Maybe make this a weekly checkup. 
How are you doing recently? 
The past week has been really boring. Now that graduation is over and everything is settling it is time to find new roads to go forwards. I was sick for some of last week, so that dragged down my desire to go do things, but some stuff got going. But now I am home. I usually do not relish the idea of being home because it evokes a feeling of the blahs. Home to me is unexciting and family is very mediocre. I guess part of it is just that we did not spend too much time together playing as a family and in that way there is not that much warmth between us. In my constructed image, that makes this place much much worse than it really is, since it holds all of my old baggage and the current unchanged situation together. If we air that out, maybe it is something that can be changed.
