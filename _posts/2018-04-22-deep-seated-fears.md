You feel stuck.
Again.
More like, your mind refuses to move forwards.
It's gliding along; inertia keeps it going in some direction.
you're improving your volleyball skills, your climbing skills, and not much else. 
What is it that you really want?

So, gliding isn't such a bad thing. 

What sucks is that we don't know what our direction is. 
Our vector in life is currently unguided. 
There is no overarching theme to this story, to this direction we're going.
It is the path of least resistance, the easy way out. 


There's quite a bit that we are so unsure about. 
Root causes and symptoms or vice versa. 

There seems to be some deep seated fear to be. Is it a fear to be great, or to be loved. Perhaps both. 
It might be a lack of love for the self or the worst kind of self-deprecation, or self-harm. To never let me be something, to be someone.
That might be something to go to therapy for. 

Then from there, is this PMO addiction something that stems from it? or is it just another distraction or outlet that keeps us down. 
Which way does the causation go? Is it negative feedback?

Or maybe it's just being a hot-blooded young male, whom knows those pleasures. Nah, its definitely not a natural healthy thing. 

So those things, and then the whole parental thing. Which is having some responsibiltiy for their well being, and their happiness laid on my shoulders, when I don't even have a clue as to how to run my own life.

That bothers me. 

Or it is just that I wished for something better. For parents who could help guide me in these bigger questions, but they themselves have not even come close to figuring those things out. 
It definitely is a bad expectation, or at least one that will never be fulfilled. 

"If you go down the list of everything we think we want in life itâ€™s all tied up with the ability to love and be loved."

And a big part of us is missing that point. 
I think the feeling of being loved, somehow rubs the wrong way, or we just can't stand it for long, as if the other person is wrong, that somehow we are unloveable, and they are crazy or confused.
How am I supposed to live my life like that?

If nothing else, finding a therapist will help with keeping this on a schedule. To have this digging guided, and kept up.

In other news, we're definitely good friends now. And you probably could hug her, but you'd need a reason. 
I think it is doable, but amy is already long gone. And though, having a crush on a close friend was always probably okay depending on emotional ability, but maybe that wasn't the real question that needed an answer.
More whether or not it would be worth it. 

I find it a bit funny though, that the more you care about someone, the more you can hurt them. Or the more you do hurt them. Where the amount of insults or subtle digs is indicative of friendship. As in, I don't have to hide everything because we are definitely friends. 
Did you want anything else from her?
She's... personality 7, looks 7, ambitions 6, attitude 5, so lots of work. You're definitely attracted to her, or just long hair asians. Is this an oedipus thing? I guess white girls are cute too.

It's definitely interesting though, to feel the bond strengthen, and the cascade of little things that you do as we get more comfortable. 

actions. 
Maybe in the end, it doesn't matter right now, if you don't have EVERYTHING figured out, but that when you do see the little vectors, that you should follow them. Even without a bigger map.
Go find some therapy, go figure out your insurance, and settle some confusion and questions in your heart.
