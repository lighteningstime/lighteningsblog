Take it slow
Step by painful step
Joy is never immediate on anything worth doing

Expect more of your "friends" 
Let them closer to your center
And maybe drop those who don't matter

Self-consciousness can be corrected by looking more towards the positive side in things
and that spending time alone does not necessarily mean you failed your goals 
It's good to bring something new to the table, unheard, unseen. 

lead me. 
Lead. 
It's your life, go take it where you want to

Finding places to seek comfort
there's very little in it about venting, and dumping frustrations
You might be quite difficult to open up to

How might we evaluate worth?
or is it just going to be a very generic feeling

There also needs to be some time spent on where we want to go
Where we want to be
and try to speed up the process in getting there

Take it slow
step by step
with courage
All is well.
