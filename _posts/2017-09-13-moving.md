Moving in.
Just got into the temporary apartment, which is much much fancier than my own price point will be, so hopefully this doesn't spoil me for getting a shittier apartment. 
I may have packed a bit too much though since they almost have everything I need around here. 

Moving on. 
I guess the gist was that you have no space for me in your life, whether or not that's just that you don't believe in close guy/girl friendships, or that I'm just not worth it. I guess I don't know. It also happens to be a polite way for rejection. So, I guess that's what it is. I should learn already that not everyone you open up to will reciprocate or be comfortable enough to want it. 

But whatever it is, I guess I have nothing but waiting or rather, setting it aside, since distance is no friend of closeness. 

Then the last thing is: 
Do you enjoy spending your time with me? 

if not, then I really should give up, because there's nothing then. But I do feel it from you, which means I could be completely mistaken. ahhh...

And now my big welcome to the Chicago area, and goodbye Michigan. May these years here be my chance to come closer to what I wish to be.
