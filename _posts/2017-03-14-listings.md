I still have not moved forwards with a lot of things in my life. Maybe it would be helpful to list those out in writing so I have it in some visible form.

- Open up to Grace about stuff (depression/meds/therapy/girlfriend)
- Talk to Amy again... ( ask for another lunch talk? )
- Keep up with Iris more, and maybe attempt to talk talk for once
- Come to a peace with Maxine, and redefine your relationship
- make new friends
- Elizabeth? before the year ends.
- make new guy friends.
- Work on projects
- Go to the GYM
- Try meditating daily
- Pick up cold showers again
- Less video games
- More reading
- More typing, less wasd-ing 
- contact people from farther away
- talk to johnny tan?
- talk to Tan
- Talk to Alex
- but most of all, take it slow, this is for checkboxes, not for long list anxieties!
- Be awesome, and try your best.
