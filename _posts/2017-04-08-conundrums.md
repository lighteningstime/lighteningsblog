Conundrums, so many puzzles that we need to solve in life, or as if in high school, and our math teacher tried to make us call them "quests" rather than "problems" so that we wouldn't feel so stressed in solving them. Quite a silly idea, but still makes some sense. The thing there is trying to sweep a fear, the fear or problems, and what they mean for my life, what they say about me as a human being. I think calling them my life's puzzles would be a similar idea. It seems my own take is something in between all of these. Where problems do end up just being questions to consider in my free time, and are definitely puzzling, or they wouldn't take so much thought. 

This weekend was a good practice in real puzzles. Puzzles of the actual puzzling type. Good for me though right, and I even walked away with a little bit of prize money to boot. 

But the biggest lesson came after the dust settled, and our fever pitch of deadline approaching stress finally reached its climax. Someone gets super snappy and cannot control their stress... (a bad quality for any kind of leader). 
We left a bunch of puzzles unsolved, and got stuck a whole lot. And that ending showed that we really just had to take a step back a reevaluate, and things were simple. Being caught up in the partial solutions that we thought we had really made things harder for us in unnecessary ways. So really the lesson is to try to reframe things that have become really difficult in an attempt to see if we've rolled into a dead end then extricate ourselves. 

But the larger things in life, is meta-cognition, and self evaluation and reflection. It is always important to be able to step back from the daily grind and take a look at the course of my life and where it is going. To check things out in a calm and collected manner, as an uninvested third party. Something that I should be doing more of.
