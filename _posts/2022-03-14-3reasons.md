Three reasons why it is required to tell him about us.

## Integrity
Your commitment means something and that needs to be upheld. If you were my girlfriend I would expect you to tell me if you cheated, so that we could try to work things out. Obviously it’s preferable to work things out before that point, but now that it has already happened, the commitment should mean enough to tell me. It is a form of trusting your word that the commitment is worth more than your fear of repurcussions.

## Consequences
Having to suffer the consequences for your actions. Hiding something like this doesn’t help you learn and grow, it only serves to make it more likely to happen again.

## Release
Hiding these things will only hurt you in the long run. It’s better to get these things off your chest so it doesn’t fester into a toxic ball of shame. Also learning that doing bad things doesn’t make you a bad person. That you can have this action judged by another, and not be something you will forever judge yourself for.
