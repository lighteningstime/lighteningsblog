What does it feel like?
The bitter taste of failure and wrestling with the thought of having such a deficiency of self, that it is not capable of being something that is so simple for anybody else, or most other people. 

Though that is the uncompassionate viewpoint, and in my case, I could call it "depressive realism." Which while true, only serves to expose an obviously painful fault and not do too much to heal it in any capacity.  
But it's still mostly my fault anyways. So why do others have to suffer for it?

I guess the only consolation is to say that it will be okay in the end, and... not much else.
