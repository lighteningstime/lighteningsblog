I am tired of living this life.

I feel like I cannot control my own thoughts and feelings.

I have nobody that I really care about anymore.

My parents have long felt out of reach. 

James is too busy for me. 

Amy is over. 

Maxine is probably not a healthy choice, if only for your addiction. 

My course correction can't overcome this. There is no way to get out of this downward arc and it's heading towards a nosedive. 

And I haven't ever thought of trying to fix the damn thing. 

I am a high functioning addict to porn.

But my life is slipping, and stalling.

And I don't want to be here when it starts falling.

So. 
Pull together all of your courage
Pull together all of your being.
let's fight this and fix it. 
Or we are done for


Let's do this.
