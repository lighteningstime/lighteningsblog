You reached out to tell me your side of the story. And it hurts. I can take you at your word, and leave you alone. As much as it hurts, there really is no alternative for me that doesn't screw things up even more. 

Maybe it is judgemental, but it feels like a classic avoidant way to be. That you push down the feeling of loss, and are happy for a bit. You make what you have sound pretty good, but I know that you're still hurting inside. And then, however long it takes, that pain will come creeping back. But that is purely theoretical, and maybe I am completely wrong about the connection that we shared. Maybe it truly wasn't anything worth keeping. Maybe it isn't worth trying to get back. To make work. Maybe this love will stay packed away forever, never to be explored, never to be lived out. Never again to see the light of day. Maybe it just won't happen fast enough.

And it hurts, it's massively painful for me. I got myself so attached to you, thinking that you felt the same, that you might stick around forever. But, you didn't understand, or you didn't feel everything that I had to offer. Or that I didn't give you the stability that you desperately needed first. I don't know. 

For me it's really a low point in my life. The lowest since I've connected with my emotional core. I've lost you, the deepest connection that I've ever forged with someone, and I'm losing my parents. My mother thinks she is finally dying, and my dad doesn't know what to do about it. And I see too much, know too much. About why things turned out this way, about how one could fix it, but I've got no ideas how to get it there. Everything feels like it's falling apart, and I'm falling apart, and I need to cry every day now to keep the pressure from making me explode. I want to punch something, I want to hurt myself, to let out all this anguish, to yell and rage at the world for how unfair this all is. That I tried my best, and I put in so much effort, and I all feel is pain. 

I just feel this emptiness trying to overtake me and I feel so powerless to stop it. And I can't numb out in the same way I did before. I can't just sleep like shit and masturbate all of my pain away. It doesn't work anymore. I wish it did. I don't want this. I don't want this much pain.

But I know this is just the opposite of the happiness that reached to the heavens, and I can't have that without allowing this much pain in my life. I just wish I had someone that I could truly lean on first. But, hopefully this will only happen once. That life will work in my favor once this is through. 

I have grace to help me, but she's too far to comfort me and hold me as much as I really need, and I don't want to lean on her too much. So for now I am hurting, trying to test my resolve, and test my new strength. To be able to spread some of my load where I need to, to be able to keep going as best as I can.
