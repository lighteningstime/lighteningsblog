Well one week was a pretty good streak. And I think it felt really good. But I'm still on video games, so there needs to be a dopamine fix too. 
And relapsing feels like this.
That I am worthless and my brain brings back all of the rejection in my life and tries to say: "You know what? They're right about you. You're a worthless piece of shit."

And I want to tell you. I understand, because sometimes I think I'm not worth it either. 

Then again, it's really hard to get someone else to love you when you don't love yourself. 

And you still haven't found a best friend yet.

Maybe that'll be your milestone. The moment when you can feel properly again. When you can feel safe enough to be open and vulnerable. 

It might be awhile, but it WILL HAPPEN.
i hope.



ah relapsing is just horrible.
