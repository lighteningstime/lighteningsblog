Effort... I had started this post about 2 weeks previous, which would explain the large gap in posts... just being lazy mostly. I am slowly coming to the realization that maybe a lot of the relationships that you have with people are dying out because of you, and not because of anyone else. To feel so alone by yourself and yet not want to reach out is almost foolish. So at least catching that as a problem is a plus. Over the past few weeks we have been trying to move outwards again, talking to people and catching up with them. Life has been better, and we're not sure if it because of the drugs or just me growing up and moving on with my life.
