So many little topics and ideas.

You react really badly when you see that it's hurting other people
Being forced vs coercion or is it just too sensitive to negatives or imagined repurcussions?
Inability to deal with people who do not have their elf-worth connected properly
	And a personal problem as well, since I cannot say that mine is rock solid at all. 
	You don't know how much time I spent trying to figure this shit out. 

	13 reasons.
		problems: the idea of sending people tapes is both self-righteous self-victimization and giving control to others. 
		A feeleing of loss of control is a primary driver for depression, and a realistic symptom as well, though obviouslyi unhealthy.
		feeling powerless in my own life has led me to blame others for my failinggs and rationalize my self through that.
		Letters sent in such a manner has no good will and therefore does not have any or much good effect as a result. 


	Going through the wringer eh? one of our supposed benefits is that like grammar in a language, those who learn and understand it through hard work and not upbringing,
	have a much clearer perspective on what things are and what they mean. The analogy is Enlish Grammar. A lot of people who natively speak english will have no idea what a subjunctive clause is or anything like that, while being perfeectly apable of using it. This just makes it harder to teach and to more intimately or deeply understand how things might function.

Rebuilding goodwill. a cornerstone of a good friendship or any kindn of relationship would be the idea of good will. The unspoken promise that someone means well to you, and that their actions will not be performed out of malice or as a means to hurt or attack. Fostering this starts from the first impression, and appearing very simply as a caring type of person. Someone who values the lives and success? or well-being of others. Breaking something as fragile as this, is a bad time. Words do not easily fix anything..
And so, why are we still friends? trust no longer exist, or the more basic version, which is goodwill. Without it all slightly negative comments are assumeed as attacks on intelligence. And trust is really hard to rebuild, maybe reforge would be a better image.

What do you want out of other people? 
	interesting conversation, which is deep or has depth
	Simple communication as in small slip ups with no intent to hurt are easily looked past, because they don't sting that badly.
	just being able to enjoy a good time and the time is worth spending. 
	LIke JT said, we must water those relationships, though you could take the analogy further along and put forth the idea that different people are different types of plants.
	Some need more water, or more light, or better temperatures, or different nutrients.
	Like my snake plants only need water once ever month maybe. Though the weird artifact in the analogy is that relationships will change and develop over time, or change types 
	Interesting thought to expand on at a later date.

Worry
So, definitey a lot of the problem is the fact that self-worth is tied to the wrong kinds of things. 
	I personaly had it stuck to my accomoplishments or smartness or whatever and so anything that attacked my intelligence really hurt because that was my sense of worth
	I guess that still is a bit true in more ssubtle ways with procrastination with perceived hard tasks/subjects
	You can tie it to others as in relationships, or your personality in saying that you are a well-liked person, and thereore valuable. But people are fickle, and not always stable sources, so when relationship troubles come along, this can be quite badly shaken
	What else can someone tie their self-worth to? well, mostly it's about sticking it poorly to someone else's opinion and having an outsider evaluate your worth for you, either explicitly or implicitly. like directly saying "I value you" make a high, or getting not first place, being a low. as explicit or implicit. 
	It definitely is something to work on, and for you, some of your worth is still tied to the intelligence thing, which causes some bad behaviours sometimes. Jealousy, procrastination, malicious competitiveness, etc.

The most useful problem to solve is the interfacing question. 
	How does one deal with someone else with inproperly secured sense of self?
	its a million dollar qustion and opens up a ton of new people. 

We always make ourselves the angels of our stories, as protagoists to our own story, we can never be wrong by natural isntinct. Something about evolutionary adaptation to suppress our bad behaviour, because quite simply, it is so much harder to live thinking that I am shit, than it is not to. And that is one theory for the purpose of depression. Which means (cognitive dissonance?) that thinking of being a bad person isn't all too common, (just look at the politicians spouting shit) And it probably causes a lot of pain to actually believe that.
