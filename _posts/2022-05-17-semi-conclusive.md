I've gone through a lot of the thoughts on my side, and all of it is true, but there's one more layer, and that is the personal growth thing. The two main ideas that held me back are my own feeling of not being ready, not feeling worthy or good enough for you, but also my gut also had worries about you and your emotional repression. I know you told me about it, but I feel it too, and I've tried poking at it from a bunch of different angles to try to understand what it's about. And I think I understand it enough to help support you through it, but I can't push you to get started. I can't push you to take the first step. And I've felt myself pushing it, trying to rush you into that realization, because I don't want to wait that long. I want to show you that there's a better way to be, and you don't have to hate yourself so much, you don't have to feel so dead inside, and I've personally worked through it myself.

And I do feel super grateful for you. For you helped to push me forward in my growth even if you didn't know it. Your acceptance and your comfort and your love, let me be the most vulnerable I've ever been with another. And to me you are the one person I've loved the most in my life so far.

But that you'll get there when you're good and ready. And as much as I want that for you, as much as I love you, I can't push you there, I can't rush you. I don't want our story to end here, because I've seen the glimpses of what it could be, how some real TLC really changes you and opens up your heart. I want to see that Hannah again, I want that to be your reality. The summer of fun Hannah, who is full of life.

So in my mind, the two obvious openings are if you come back having realized that either: that I did love you a whole lot, perhaps more than anyone else ever has. OR that even though you said a lot of good things about him, you got bored of him too, and you want to know what was so special about me.

And I wonder if it'll happen.

I know your anger at me is fueled by the pain, not real hatred. And as much as it hurts to feel your anger, I can tell you're still hurting, and that is so much worse. That your rationalizations for transforming your pain into anger creates two incorrect stories. About me stringing you along, about me being fully to blame for your cheating. I hope the pain will fade enough in time, that you can see the truth. And it hurts for good reason. That this love we shared went deeper than any other. I feel like I've lost a big chunk of myself, and it hurts more than anything else. It's pushing me to the edges of my experience in emotional pain, and I get to suffer through it with my eyes wide open. And I would say this is why more emotionally connected people don't get in and out of relationships that often, because to truly connect with someone, to truly give it a good shot and get attached, it hurts too much to undo those bonds, that it really is going to take me almost a full year to recover enough to genuinely be with someone else. Anything sooner will just feel like a rebound.

And I'm going to be trying my best to move forward. That I almost had to let you go first to let myself move forwards. There's always going to be this faint hope that one day you'll wake up and realize that what we had was something else, something special and unique that you want, and maybe you'll come calling. But that is just my fantasy, and I'm not going to be waiting by the phone for it.

Can you keep living how you are after experiencing me?
How long until your heart rebels against your actions? 
Or is the pain be too overwhelming to ever understand?

My heart is waiting. Waiting for you or waiting to heal. Either way ends up being the same. But my life is moving forwards, to new people, to a better Denny. To taking these lessons and these new skills and going out to make the life that I want, happen.
