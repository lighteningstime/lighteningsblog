today I was a good cook. I started out a little late for my personal timetable, but finished everything at exactly 6PM when I said I would, and all the food came out pretty delicious. So the menu was 
* steak 
* boxed scalloped potatoes 
* onion 
* roast asparagus 
Cooked for 4 people and costing about 20-30 bucks for 12 ounces of steak a person.
