It feels like the same traumatic moments that keep being repeated, are they supposed to have dissipated? Is it possible to take out all of the emotional charge from those events? It is a memory, and looking at it no longer hurts, but maybe the pain stores up in those places first. 

That amorphous visual about my parents yelling at each other. It probably isn't even a true memory, but a patchwork of feelings and things that happened repeatedly blended together. Dad's hole in the drywall, and the regular angry yelling. Yelling about grades, about doing my homework, about everything. It always made me feel so guilty, so responsible, but I know that it's not the truth anymore. 

Sushi making and walking in on my brother's seizure. Getting sent to the neighbor's to play Diablo in their basement on the computer. Getting lost in the game until my parents came back from the hospital to let me back home to sleep. That along with all the other video game memories. Playing rayman at the peter/charko house. Dynasty warriors and pokemon on terrance's consoles. They never spent that much time with me, just let me do my own thing and play my video games. And I was distracted, so I never felt my loneliness. All that Warcraft playing makes more sense too. Sneaking to get on the gamecube, because else was there any kind of happiness in my life? It was far and few between elsewhere. 

Those school ones with other people. Getting excluded by the cool kids. Getting rejected from playing with my brother and kris. 

All the little damages and harms along the way. Abandonment, arguments, accusations, disconnection. The whole library of bad traumatic memories, and never anyone to talk through them with. It's my own responsibility now isn't it. I get to go back and parent myself in the way that I want to be.
