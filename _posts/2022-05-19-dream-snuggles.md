I had a dream with you. You were sitting on the edge of the bed, and I crawled up behind you and pulled you down on top of me to snuggle with you. And we just lay there, with me stroking your belly, and you started nibbling on my ear. It felt so comforting. That familiar weight of you on top of me, and us just relaxing together. And I felt at peace. I wonder if it means anything, or if I am just reliving my memories. Things that will never happen again, or things that I've loved and lost and my subconscious is making peace with.
