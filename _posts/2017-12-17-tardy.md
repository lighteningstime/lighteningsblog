Trying to finally get my day started.

How is it you're feeling?

Lonely.

Yesterday was a great day! and then it ended pretty meh.
Maybe video games and porn and all no matter what will defuse the best of days. 
It certainly killed all my momentum. 
And now I feel in a downward trend. 
I signed up for a reddit badge for nofap since that seems to be my #1 on the checklist. 
If I can conquer that then it's aimless videogaming next, so maybe I will get a switch to play for real enjoyment. 

wasted time is that which you spent in distraction from what you want to be doing. So even playing a game you really enjoy for the pleasure of the game, IS a valid "non time waste"
I think my brain has come to demonize video games in general because of the way I learned to perceive them. 

This nofap thing might be right. It feels like a low-grade self-loathing that is so very hard to shake. Something really needs to change, but what exactly is hard to tell. Maybe that is it.

So for today
- do some pushups
- read for at least 30 minutes 
- think about or up to 1 hour of work
- consider the food in your fridge
