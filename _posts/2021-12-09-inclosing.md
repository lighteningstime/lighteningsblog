Closing Ideas:

Going to drag you along with me on the self-development path, if you're willing to face yourself.

This combo of pushing feelings down, and extended dwell time, and feeling things aren't great. Feels to me like either lack of emotional maturity in self-understanding, and/or some innate inertia; a fear of being alone. Like how Grace can spend 7 years with a guy, and be out of love for the past 5.

To me it's, why settle for less than what you're worth. And I kind of hoped you could find somebody almost as good, just to see if you really really want me and not just the sex.

Anyone can hold you close and be a warm body to cuddle, and we'd all rather have that, but if it conflicts with our values and desires, it's not worth it. So if dating is about finding the best guy, it's better to be free to search after you already know that it's not it. You know, it's only that you were free that we became a thing. Though maybe that was a bad thing.

My search is for true confidence. A being at home in the world; anywhere and everywhere. And I guess I was too scared to make the first step, so you kicked me out of the warmth of the bed, and I'm in a lot of pain, but still thankful. It was always something; too scared to start, or waiting for COVID to die down, or the stars to align.

And you know, I would love something easy too, but for something long-lasting, you've got to put the work in to make it easy. So really it is putting in the effort to smooth out the path ahead, while also being a better driver.

But your type of search for ease, at least this one, I would put into a rebound response, good enough to stop the pain, but not necessarily looking for the best. But it is seemingly a repeat of your past partners too, so maybe there is something to it.

If you love something, let it go. If it doesn't come back, it was never yours to begin with. Maybe after the high of the sex wears off, you'll feel completely differently about me. And that will be the truth of it. Or he'll figure out how to do things right, and you'll be satisfied.

The definite end is...

Can you ask him how much porn he uses? both with you and without you? I'm curious and want a data point.

I'm ready, but a few things
- i'm going to drag you along with me in my self-development. If that's a dealbreaker, let me know now.
- The main condition is that you spend 2 weeks alone to get over things, think things through, and move on. And I'll get disentangled with everything I've got going.
- Let me know when 2 weeks from your last interaction is, and then I'll take you on a date.
