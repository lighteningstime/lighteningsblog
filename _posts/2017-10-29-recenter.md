It needs some time to put together. 
I just need more sleep and some time to put myself together. To calm down about the progress that I make, and to quiet the voices that try to hold me back and belittle.
To grow to fill the shoes of what I was "meant" to be, and not what I am now. Or maybe there are no shoes, as there's no final end point besides death, and those shoes aren't very hard to fill...

It's to see your personal deficiencies, but in a more distanced manner, as things to work towards, rather than failures. Or maybe just incomplete things. Though, in life there is no such thing as complete, so you'll never have that checklist completely checked off. It'll be interesting to try and shift that view.

You have your list of things to do, now how do we make them happen. one step at a time on a bad day?
